Half-Life is a critically acclaimed game, also the #1 selling Single-Player PC game with over 9.3-million copies sold, and has earned over 50 Game-of-the-Year awards. Its mods and expansions have helped continue the success and popularity of Half-Life.\n\nThe games should all work completely under any modern version of Windows (95 through Vista) without any problems.\n\nYou can either burn the images to CD using any MDS compatible CD burning program or mount them with a program such as Daemon Tools.\n\nThe original Half-Life multiplayer network (WON.net) has been shut-down. Steam, the replacement network for all Valve games, requires a legit cd-key to play. The keys included in &quot;keys.txt&quot; will not work with Steam. To play these games online with friends, you must connect via a Virtual Private Network, such as Hamachi (http://www.hamachi.cc/). Join a Hamachi network with your friends, create a LAN game, and everyone should be able to join.\n\n- Published by Sierra\n- Developed by Valve\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInstall Order (for full installation):\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Half Life CD\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Team Fortress CD\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Opposing Force CD\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Blue Shift CD (Includes optional High Definition model pack, highly recommended)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Counter-Strike CD\n  Note: The Counter-Strike CD will install separately from Half-Life.
