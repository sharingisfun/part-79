Noyce defined the unconventional, innovative culture of Silicon Valley - the likes of Apple and Google would be influenced by his egalitarian management style, which was inspired by his religious upbringing.\nPodfather shows why Noyce may be the most important person most people have never heard of. Contributors include industry giants Gordon Moore and Andy Grove.\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n* Video Codec: XviD\n* Video Bitrate: 1559 KB/s\n* Video Aspect Ratio: 1:76\n* Video Resolution: 704 x 400\n* Audio Codec: (Dolby AC3)\n* Audio BitRate: 192kb/s 48000Hz\n* Run-Time: 59mins\n* Framerate: 25FPS\n* Number Of Parts: 1\n* Part Size: 744mb/s\n* Ripped by artistharry\n* Subtitles: English\n* Source: TV-CAP\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d42b6b96463d5b90f0e70550a58899c27d79978","amp;dn":"BBC_The_Podfather_DVB.XviD.AC3.ShareReactor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d42b6b96463d5b90f0e70550a58899c27d79978","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,66,182,185,100,99,213,185,15,14,112,85,10,88,137,156,39,215,153,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
