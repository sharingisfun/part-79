When the Muddy Waters band quit the master en masse in 1980, most of the sidemen stuck together and formed their own group. The Legendary Blues Band, as they were named, included Pinetop Perkins, Jerry Portnoy, Willie Smith, and Calvin Jones throughout its early years. Short-term member Louis Myers, another Muddy Waters alumnus, appeared as guitarist on the band's first album (Rounder, 1981). The band has since changed personnel with some regularity, and while its lineup has become progressively less &quot;legendary&quot; in name or historic associations, its music has remained solid and true to the mainstream Chicago style. In a later configuration, they even made the Billboard Black Music charts. Recent albums have featured guitarist Billy Flynn and harmonicist Madison Slim. The rhythm section of Jones and Smith has anchored the unit throughout the changes, never failing to deliver the Chicago blues with aplomb.\nBy Jim O'Neal, All Music Guide.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.You Never Miss Me (3:58)\n02.Stop Your Complaining (3:29)\n03.Lonesome for My Baby (3:38)\n04.Blues Today (5:25)\n05.Monday Morning (3:34)\n06.Sweet Thing (3:06)\n07.I Don't Know (4:08)\n08.I'm Your) Hoochie Coochie Man (5:18)\n09.Big Town Playboy (3:49)\n10.One Day Till Christmas (3:58)\n\nmp3   VBR   224-320kbps\n\n\nwith all covers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:386005719d0485786ad4999222aff80d864c6f55","amp;dn":"Legendary+Blues+Band+-+Prime+Time+Blues+%281992%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"386005719d0485786ad4999222aff80d864c6f55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,96,5,113,157,4,133,120,106,212,153,146,34,175,248,13,134,76,111,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
