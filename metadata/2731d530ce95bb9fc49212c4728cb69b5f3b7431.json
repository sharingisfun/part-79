The objects, along with the Holy Lance of Longinus and many other artifacts, had been stolen by the Nazis from Austria after the Anschluss in 1938 and,conceivably, could have been used by Nazis to motivate Germans in the creation of a Fourth Reich.\n\nThrough research, investigation, and amateur detective work, Horn explored the continuing threats inherent in Nazi mythology while successfully solving the core mystery of the disappearance of the crown jewels. Definitely speculative in the suggestion that a mysterious new order of Teutonic Knights might exist for malevolent political purposes, Horn's story is an interesting footnote to the history of WWII.\n\nEach file contains the proper ID Tags and cover Art.\n\n\nTechnical Specs:\n\nSource: Audio CD (9 CDs)\nOutput: VBR/ MP3\nAudio: 2 channel stereo\nSample Rate: 44.1 Khz\nTotal Run Time: 10:47:38\n \n                                  -enJOY and pls seed-\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2731d530ce95bb9fc49212c4728cb69b5f3b7431","amp;dn":"Sidney+Kirkpatrick+-+Hitler%5C%27s+Holy+Relics+-+%28CDRip.MP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2731d530ce95bb9fc49212c4728cb69b5f3b7431","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,49,213,48,206,149,187,159,196,146,18,196,114,140,182,155,95,59,116,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
