Carlin's not resting on his laurels here, presenting an abundance of new, politically incorrect material while expanding a few older routines. In &quot;Sports&quot; he applies hilarious criteria to what does or doesn't qualify (hockey doesn't count; lacrosse is a &quot;faggot college activity&quot;), and &quot;A Moment of Silence&quot; pays mock-mournful tribute to an ill-fated (and presumably fictional) group of &quot;43 elderly, mentally retarded Bolivian senior citizen volleyball fans.&quot; If that kind of irreverence puts you off (and if so, why are you reading this?), you'll fare better with the universal humor of &quot;Losing Things&quot; (we all do it, right?), and a characteristic survey of language in &quot;Hello and Goodbye.&quot; In any case, Carlin's best enjoyed when seen and heard, and the film noir spoof &quot;The Envelope&quot; provides a clever introduction to the funnyman's entrance onstage.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4d6897a378deae57286866ee0ecf4f5b5e50e71","amp;dn":"George+Carlin+-+Playing+With+Your+Head+%5B1986%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4d6897a378deae57286866ee0ecf4f5b5e50e71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,214,137,122,55,141,234,229,114,134,134,110,224,236,244,245,181,229,14,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
