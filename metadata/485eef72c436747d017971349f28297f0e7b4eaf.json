Leon Lai and Richie Jen headline the hardboiled crime actioner as opposing cops with dark pasts that build to even darker consequences. Packed with gritty action and stylistic shootouts choreographed by action director Chin Kar Lok, Fire of Conscience paves the way for a brooding, burning showdown between two flawed men with many bullets at their disposal. An impressive supporting cast that includes freshly crowned Hong Kong Film Awards Best Supporting Actress Michelle Ye, Taiwan actress Vivian Hsu, Mainland actor Wang Baoqiang (Equation of Love and Death), and Liu Kai Chi (Beast Stalker) adds compelling character drama to this quintessential Hong Kong crime thriller.\n\nIll-tempered, unshaven street detective Manfred (Leon Lai) is quick to deal justice with his fists, and constantly on the hunt for the pickpocket who killed his wife. Slick inspector Kee (Richie Jen) is a rising star in the force with more than a few skeletons in his closet. A string of possibly related incidents - a cop killing, a drug raid, and a murdered prostitute - brings the starkly different detectives on the same beat. The two assist each other when their investigations cross paths, but a fatally botched operation soon reveals there's a traitor among them. \n\nBit rate                         : 1 000 Kbps\nWidth                            : 704 pixels\nHeight                           : 304 pixels\n\nAudio (1) : Cantonese Dolby Digital-5.1 channels 448kbps\nAudio (2) : Mandarin mp3         \n\nSubs :      English, Chinese\n\nDuration  : 1h 45mn\n\nRetail BR\n\n                    VERY EXPLOSIVE\n\n\nDVDr is here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5566895&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5566895&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:485eef72c436747d017971349f28297f0e7b4eaf","amp;dn":"Fire+of+Conscience+2010+BRRip+XviD-sailo1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"485eef72c436747d017971349f28297f0e7b4eaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,94,239,114,196,54,116,125,1,121,113,52,159,40,41,127,14,123,78,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
