The album, produced by Babyface, Keith Thomas, Rob Mathes, and Rex Rideout, features songs written by Stevie Wonder, Bill Withers, Babel Gilberto, Phil Galdston and Babyface. Williams' herself has described the album as &quot;a hybrid of samba, bossa nova, some salsa and also some pop and R&amp;B&quot;.\n\nVanessa Lynn Williams (born March 18, 1963) is an American singer, songwriter and actress. Williams made history on September 17, 1983 when she became the first woman of African American descent to be crowned Miss America. Williams' reign as Miss America came to an abrupt end when scandal led to her subsequent resignation of the title. Williams rebounded by launching a career as an entertainer, earning Grammy, Emmy, and Tony Award nominations.\n\nWilliams began competing in beauty pageants in the early 1980s. Williams won Miss New York in 1983, and went to the Miss America national pageant in Atlantic City. She was crowned Miss America 1984 on September 17, 1983 making her the first-ever Miss America of African American descent. Prior to the final night of competition, Williams won both the Preliminary Talent and Swimsuit Competitions from earlier in the week. Williams' reign as Miss America was not without its challenges and controversies. For the first time in pageant history, a reigning Miss America was the target of death threats and angry racist hate mail.\n\nTen months into her reign as Miss America, she received an anonymous phone call stating that nude photos of her taken by a photographer prior to her pageant days had surfaced. Williams believed the photographs were private and had been destroyed; she claims she never signed a release permitting the photos to be used.\n\nThe genesis of the photos dated back to 1982, when she worked as an assistant and makeup artist for Mount Kisco, New York photographer Tom Chiapel. According to Williams, Chiapel advised her that he wanted to try a &quot;new concept of silhouettes with two models.&quot; He photographed Williams and another woman in several nude poses, including simulated lesbian sex.\n\nAfter days of media frenzy and sponsors threatening to pull out of the upcoming 1985 pageant, Williams felt pressured by Miss America Pageant officials to resign, and did so in a press conference on July 23, 1984. The title subsequently went to first-runner up, African-American Suzette Charles. In early September 1984, Williams filed a $500 million lawsuit against Chiapel and Guccione. According to a Williams family representative, she eventually dropped the suit to avoid further legal battles choosing to move on with her life. Williams is quoted as saying &quot;the best revenge is success.&quot;\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e53d334c5ecd313df1695505cbefd7af23f7c6ee","amp;dn":"Vanessa+Williams+-+Just+Friends","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e53d334c5ecd313df1695505cbefd7af23f7c6ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,61,51,76,94,205,49,61,241,105,85,5,203,239,215,175,35,247,198,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
