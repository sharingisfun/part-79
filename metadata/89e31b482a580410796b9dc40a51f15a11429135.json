When Plume Delivery was cut, the band had yet to play a live gig; in the EPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wake, the 1900s did countless shows in Chicago and Champaign, Ill., as well as festivals like SXSW and Lollapalooza. All the gig hours logged show in the songwriting, which is more cohesive, more aware of which pop constructs work (and which donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t), and more thematic without the effort of laying on added instrumentation (the tunes are pretty cottony thick to begin with).&quot;\n\n+- 250kb/s (VBR)\n\n1.
