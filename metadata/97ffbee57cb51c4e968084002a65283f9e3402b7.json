For this purpose low voltage \nalternating current electric potentials are applied to the treatment vessel which are of the order of from \nabout 0.2 to 12 volts and produce current flow densities in the blood or other fluids of from one \nmicroampere per square millimeter of electrode area exposed to the fluid being treated to about two \nmilliamperes per square millimeter. \n\nIt is now well known in the medical profession and the general public that blood collected in a blood \nbank from a large number of donors may be contaminated by contaminants such as bacteria, virus, \nparasites and/or fungus obtained from even a single donor. While screening of donors has done much to \nalleviate this problem, the screening of donors can and does miss occasional donors whose blood is unfit \nfor use. When this occurs and the unfit blood is mixed with otherwise usable blood, the entire batch must\nbe discarded for transfusion purposes. Because of this problem, the present invention has been devised to \nattenuate any bacteria, virus (including the AIDS HIV virus) parasites and/or fungus contained in blood \ncontributed by a donor to the point that any such contaminant is rendered ineffective for infecting a \nnormally healthy human cell, but does not make the blood biologically unfit for use in humans. Similar \nproblems exist with respect to treatment of other body fluids, such as amniotic fluids. The treatment \nmethod and system is also applicable to mammals other than humans. \n\nIn addition to the above, there is a need for methods and systems for the treatment of blood and other \nbody fluids both in in-situ processing wherein the treated blood and/or other body fluids are withdrawn \nfrom the body, treated and then returned to the body in a closed loop, recirculating treatment process that \nis located near but outside the patient's body, or the treatment can be effected through implanted \ntreatment system components. \n\nThe present invention provides new electrically conductive methods and systems using alternating \nelectric current excitation potentials for treating blood and/or other body fluids, such as amniotic fluids, \nand/or synthetic fluids such as tissue culture medium from a donor to a transfusion recipient or to a \nstorage receptacle, or for recirculating a single donor's or patient's blood or other body fluids. The \ntreatment can be accomplished in a treatment system external of the body or by implant devices for \npurging contaminants using a novel electrically conductive vessel for direct electric treatment of blood \nor other body fluids, such as amniotic fluids, with alternating current electric field forces of appropriate \nelectric field strength to attenuate such contaminants to the extent that bacteria, virus, fungus, and/or \nparasites contained in the blood or other body fluids are rendered ineffective to infect and/or affect \nnormally healthy human cells. The treatment, however, does not render the blood or other body fluids \nbiologically unfit for use in humans or other mammals after the treatment. The new methods and systems \naccording to the invention achieve these ends without requiring time consuming and expensive \nprocessing procedures and equipment in addition to those normally required in the handling of blood or \nother body fluids or synthetic fluids. The invention can be used to achieve the electric field force \ntreatment during the normally occurring transfer processing from a donor to a recipient or to a collection \nreceptacle, or recirculation of a single donor's or patient's blood or other body fluids, such as amniotic \nfluids. \n\n\nText Files (Folders):\n\n1) Kaali Patent 5188738 (original idea)\n2) Constructing the Device (electronic circuit)\n3) Buying the Device (if you don't want to build it)\n\nVideo Files (Folder):\n\n4) Using the Device (Instructions from Bob Beck)\n\n\nComment: \n\nThis torrent contains Kaali's famous patent. Bob Beck's work is mostly based on this patent. Neutralizing ALL(!) pathogens with microcurrents: This sounds too good to be true, doesn't it? Most things in life that sound too good to be true are a fake and therefore we have become very suspicious of things and events sounding too good to be true. We trust what sounds frustrating and hard and boring. That GOD is real also sounds too good to be true, doesn't it? And yet GOD truly IS REAL. So therefore, why should this patent not be real too? After all, a patent will only be granted after a thorough examination by the patent office. Bob Beck has found a method of how to use this device without a surgery on the human body. He simply applies the electrodes externally above the arteries of one of your wrists. What a genius! This device is one of those the pharmaco-medical cartel wants to hide from you. They make their money with sick people, not with healed people.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97ffbee57cb51c4e968084002a65283f9e3402b7","amp;dn":"Neutralizing+ALL+Pathogens+with+Microcurrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97ffbee57cb51c4e968084002a65283f9e3402b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,255,190,229,124,181,28,78,150,128,132,0,42,101,40,63,158,52,2,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
