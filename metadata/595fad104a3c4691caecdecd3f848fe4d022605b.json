Too Any Door...Only Windows\n\n\nSince Cancer last year (asc 28 gem) I decided to make music &quot;albums&quot; for each sign of the zodiac the sun was in, at that time I used the sidereal zodiac but switched to the tropical. Ever since I was 4 at the beach songs would come to my consciousness (19/M), the first melody was &quot;the waves go crashing down, the water never drowns&quot; I've probably written over 1,000 songs and after awhile I would feel certain shifts, like my life is moving to a new level so I organized albums before I knew astrology. Now knowing what I know about astrology, these changes correspond to the life cycles of the moon and the suns trekk through my natal houses, so I use the life of the moon to make an album for each tropical sign the sun is in. And all the music I make I release free, and tomorrow I'm having a blogtv release party for my Taurus Cd &quot;Too Any Doors...Only Windows&quot; w/ free mp3 \n \nBy Sidereal Scorpio I said I had 20 albums (though most were just in my head) I've undergone what I consider to be a spiritual rebirth, and now consider this the first 2.0 album as well as I just assembled a chronological &quot;Best Of Pelican Music Stuff&quot; 09 CD. I'm very fascinating and left a good paper trail, it be fun to dig into my life with people who read the heavens. \n \nI think musically rx Mars / Neptune yods push pulling is where I can channel that &quot;spark&quot;, plus I love being a 5th House Scorpio Sun. I'll post music in this thread, hope we can have fun! \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:595fad104a3c4691caecdecd3f848fe4d022605b","amp;dn":"Too+Any+Door...Only+Windows+-+Pelican+Music+Stuff","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"595fad104a3c4691caecdecd3f848fe4d022605b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,95,173,16,74,60,70,145,202,236,222,205,63,132,143,228,208,34,96,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
