He changed his name and became a fulltime musician in the early '50s, recording a number of singles from 1960 onwards. Reed was a sideman with Earl Hooker, Buddy Guy, Albert Collins, Son Seals and others as well as leading his own band and operating the Ice Cube label. Whether or not they were half-brothers, as A.C. sometimes claimed, he was a longtime occasional borrower of Jimmy Reed's drawl and his loping rhythms. The other distinguishing features of A.C.'s music are the skinny rasp of his sax and the singing of blues about how the singing of blues doesn't pay. The joke wears thin with repetition, but it's symptomatic of a talent for original, often witty lyrics that get away from the standard topics. \nThe band is tight on this album,  A native Chicagoan, Vaughn played drums and saxophone in his teens, adding the guitar some years latter. He worked for spells with Professor Eddie Lusk, Phil Guy, Son Seals and A.C.Reed, whom he has accompanied on several albums; he has also recorded with Zora Young and Detroit Jr., and produced albums by several artists for Italian Appaloosa label. \nThis album was made in France while Vaughn was touring with A.C.Reed, (who sings on five of the album's ten tracks), offers 'Computer Took My Job' and also  'Mojo On Me',  \n\n1.
