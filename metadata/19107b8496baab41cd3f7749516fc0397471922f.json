It is a follow-up to Jaa's 2003 breakout film Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior. Initially claimed to be a sequel to Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior, Ong Bak 2 was then announced to be a prequel to its predecessor. Unlike its predecessor however, which had a contemporary and realistic setting, Ong Bak 2 is actually set in ancient Thailand  and as such, could be described as a historical epic with elements of fantasy  combined, and has nothing to do with Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior. Ong Bak 2 also has nothing to do with Jaa's 2005 film Tom-Yum-Goong, which was sometimes incorrectly labelled Ong Bak 2 in the West, as well as The Protector and The Warrior King. Tom-Yum-Goong  had a contemporary setting similar to Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior, although it too had different characters and plot. Jaa's films have yet to tie into each other, although Jaa has claimed they will do so with the release of Ong Bak 3 in 2010. As well as the different historical setting to Jaa's previous films, Ong Bak 2 has taken a notably grittier and bloodier direction.\n\nThe plot of Ong Bak 2 revolves around Tien (Jaa), the son of Lord Sihadecho, a murdered nobleman in ancient Thailand. As a spirited and unyielding youth, Tien resists savage slave traders and, moments from death, is rescued by a man known as Cher Nung. Cher Nung is a renowned warrior and leader of the Pha Beek Krut, a group of pirates/guerilla fighters, and Cher Nung realizes unsurpassed physical potential in the young Tien and takes Tien under his wing. The Pha Beek Krut are a group of expert martial artists of various styles from all over Asia, and Tien is trained to unify these different styles of martial arts, and grows into the most dangerous man alive. As Tien becomes a young man he goes on a lone mission of vengeance against the vicious slave traders who enslaved him as a youth, and also the treacherous warlord who murdered his father, Lord Rajasena, who has an entire army protecting him.\n\nCast\n\n    * Tony Jaa as Tien\n    * Tim Man as Black Ninja\n    * Nirut Sirichanya as Master Bua (as Nirut Sirijanya)\n    * Sorapong Chatree as Chernang\n    * Sarunyoo Wongkrachang as Lord Rajasena\n    * Santisuk Promsiri as Lord Sihadecho\n    * Dan Chupong as Crow Ghost (as Dance Chupong)\n    * Santisuk Promsiri as Nobleman Siha Decho\n    * Primorata Dejudom as Pim\n    * Natdanai Kongthong as Young Tien\n    * Patthama Panthong as Lady Plai\n    * Petchtai Wongkamlao as Mhen\n    * Supakorn Kitsuwon as Guard in Golden Armour (uncredited)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19107b8496baab41cd3f7749516fc0397471922f","amp;dn":"Ong+Bak+2+%5BEng%5D+DVD+RIP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19107b8496baab41cd3f7749516fc0397471922f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,16,123,132,150,186,171,65,205,63,119,73,81,111,192,57,116,113,146,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
