Lead single &quot;Soak Up the Sun&quot; peaked at #1 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart and #17 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming one of her biggest hits since &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot;. &quot;It's Only Love&quot; featured Gwyneth Paltrow on backing vocals. C'Mon C'Mon reached #2 on the UK Album Chart and on the Billboard 200, where it has sold 2.1 million units as of January 2008. Debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200 with 185,000 copies sold.\n\nAmazon.com Review By Jaan Uhelszki - Sheryl Crow's first studio album in four years shows a woman if not on the verge of a nervous breakdown, then one who has gone a little off the rails and is in the process of pulling herself back on track again. For her past three studio albums, Crow has been known as the quintessential party girl who liked a beer buzz in the morning, but C'mon, C'mon shows her to be much more than that. Breakup, illness, and loss have tempered her good-time persona, and like other life-altering events, both her character and lyrics are stronger for it. This latest offering might not break any new musical ground--again relying on her retooling of '70s country rock--but she displays an honesty and naked vulnerability not witnessed in her earlier work, honing her pain to a fine, lyrical edge. The brooding &quot;Weather Channel&quot; shows a rawboned Crow unafraid to display her emotional bruising, but without losing any of her sly wit: &quot;Just a pill to make me happy / I know it may not fix the hinges, but at least the door has stopped its creaking.&quot; Besides songs reflecting her newfound poignancy are a couple of swaggering rockers that recall middle-period Stones, including &quot;You're an Original,&quot; featuring Lenny Kravitz, the whimsical and insouciant &quot;Steve McQueen,&quot; which finds Crow boasting &quot;I ain't taking shit off of no one,&quot; and the deceptively frothy &quot;Soak Up the Sun,&quot; which features the long missing-in-action Liz Phair on background vocals. In addition to resurrecting Phair, Crow also has compiled a paparazzo's dream, soliciting the vocal talents of pals Stevie Nicks, Natalie Maines , Emmylou Harris, Don Henley, and inexplicably, the actress Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Steve McQueen\n[02] Soak Up The Sun\n[03] You're An Original\n[04] Safe And Sound\n[05] C'mon C'mon\t&gt; Featuring Stevie Nicks\n[06] It's So Easy\t&gt; Featuring Don Henley\n[07] Over You\n[08] Lucky Kid\n[09] Diamond Road\n[10] It's Only Love\t&gt; Featuring Gwyneth Paltrow\n[11] Abilene\t&gt; Featuring Natalie Maines\n[12] Hole In My Pocket\n[13] Weather Channel\t&gt; Featuring Emmylou Harris\n[14] Missing\n[15] I Want You\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time\t&gt; 01h:05m:57s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 481mb (Including FLAC, Art Covers &amp; File)\nMusic File Type\t&gt; Exact Audio Copy FLAC Level 8\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Rock\nRelease Date\t&gt; 08 April 2002 [UK] 16 April 2002 [US]\nRecord Company\t&gt; A&amp;M Records\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n&gt; http://www.sherylcrow.com\n&gt;\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheryl_Crow\n&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/c/crow.html\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/sherylcrow\n&gt;\n&gt;[Soak Up The Sun]\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27300f7f47a976de636f2dc314ca062b79af6b19","amp;dn":"%5B2002%5D+Cmon+Cmon+-+Sheryl+Crow+481mb+%5BFLAC%5D+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27300f7f47a976de636f2dc314ca062b79af6b19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,48,15,127,71,169,118,222,99,111,45,195,20,202,6,43,121,175,107,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
