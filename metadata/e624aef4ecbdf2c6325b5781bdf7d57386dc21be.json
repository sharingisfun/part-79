Gets rid of the annoying logo ads when the game starts.\n\nCut all the LOGO's \n\nCopy these files into the DamnationDamnGameMovies folder.\n(in case this doesnt show the backslashes, find the &quot;Damnation&quot; folder then the &quot;DamnGame&quot; folder and then the &quot;Movies&quot; unzip this in there)\nWhen asked to overwrite the existing files. Say Yes.\nYou may backup your old files if you wish, but why, who wants credits?\n\nStart the game and wala! go right to the game!!! \n\nThis file is zipped up, so download and just unzip it in that folder!\n\nBe watching for more for other games as over the next few days I will be releasing a \nbunch more of these.\n\n(Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯`Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¸Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¸.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯`Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·-=BeDLaM=- @ TiMeS2 FxPÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â·Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯`Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¸Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¸.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/-BeDLaM-&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/-BeDLaM-&lt;/a&gt;\nfor my other ad removal intro's!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e624aef4ecbdf2c6325b5781bdf7d57386dc21be","amp;dn":"Damnation+Ripped+Credits+Intro+replacements.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e624aef4ecbdf2c6325b5781bdf7d57386dc21be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,36,174,244,236,189,242,198,50,91,87,129,189,247,213,115,134,220,33,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
