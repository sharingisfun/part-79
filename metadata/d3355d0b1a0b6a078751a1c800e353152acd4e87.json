It should provide most of the information (including undocumented) you need to know about your hardware, software and other devices whether hardware or software. Sandra is a (girl) name of Greek origin that means &quot;defender&quot;, &quot;helper of mankind&quot;. We think that's quite fitting. It works along the lines of other Windows utilities, however it tries to go beyond them and show you more of what's really going on.
