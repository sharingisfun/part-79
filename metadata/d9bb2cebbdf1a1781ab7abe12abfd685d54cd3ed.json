On the flight he meets Adi (Rajesh), a scriptwriter, who at once takes a liking to Siddharth and asks him as to why he was going to Singapore. Siddharth tells him that he was going to find the girl, Tanu (Ramya) whom he liked. Adi, being a scriptwriter, gets interested at once and asks Siddharth to narrate the story as to why he was going to find her now. Siddharth agrees and starts narrating his experience which forms the greater part of the first half of the movie.\nTanu's Story- Siddharth, standing at the precipice of a suicide point is looking at the ground below when Tanu, a stranger to Siddharth at that point pulls him back thinking that he was going to commit suicide and gives him a good scolding without even allowing him to talk. Siddharth then goes away and sits beside a lake where again Tanu sees him and again thinks that he is going to commit suicide by jumping into the water and again gives him a good scolding and goes away. He then goes to a roadside tea stall and gets a glass of coffee and puts a sugar-free cube into the glass. Tanu sees him from a distance and thinks that he is putting poison into his glass and rushes to him and knocks off the glass from his hand before he takes his first sip. Siddharth, fed up of her misunderstanding him, scolds her telling that he was just trying to see the depth of the fall at the suicide point, and since it was hot, he was trying to splash some water to his face at the lake and that he was putting sugar-free cubes into his glass and clears the air and tells her that he was not going to commit suicide and walks away.\nAt the railway station, Siddharth waiting for his train, sees Tanu running into the station trying to catch her train which is leaving the station. She misses the train and sits on the bench next to the one Siddharth is sitting. She asks the station master for directions to the toilet. She has to cross the platform to the other side to reach the toilet so she takes the skywalk. When she goes up the skywalk, Siddharth sees the beggar who was sitting nearby, gone. He goes up the skywalk to see the beggar trying to steal the gold bangle from Tanu's arm. He shouts at the beggar and Tanu finds the distraction enough and kicks the beggar on the groin and runs towards Siddharth. They both go and sit on one bench. They introduce themselves to each other. Siddharth tells Tanu to give the bangle to him for safekeeping to which she agrees. He tucks the bangle into his backpack.\nSuddenly, Tanu sees the beggar coming towards them with four other people. She warns Siddharth. They both run away. They hide in a dark shed where there are oxen. One guy enters the shed and gets kicked by an ox. The others think that Siddharth hit their partner and get scared and run away.\nThe next morning Tanu leaves in another train. After she leaves, Siddharth realizes that she had forgotten her bangle. He gets her address from a telephone booth where she had earlier called her home from. He sets out to her hometown to return the bangle. He meets her and gives the bangle to her. She insists that he stay with her family for a few days. He agrees and she introduces him to her family members.\nTanu falls in love with Siddaharth and even he starts liking her. On the day when he was supposed to leave, Tanu proposes to him but, to her disbelief, he rejects her proposal. He then leaves for Bangalore.\nIn the flight- Adi gets shocked and asks Siddharth as to why he had rejected her proposal. Siddharth narrates another incident which made him not to get emotionally involved with girls.\n3 years ago- Divya (Keerthi Gowda), a huge fan of Siddharth, proposes to him. He thinks that she isn't serious and he accepts it just for the sake of hanging out with her. But, she actually loved Siddharth and she takes the relationship very seriously. When they were in a mall with Siddharth's band partners, he gets a work related call. He tells Divya to go home as he had some work to do. Divya insists on going with him. She tells him that since she is his girlfriend she should know about his work. Siddharth gets to know that she had taken the relationship very seriously and scolds her telling that he didn't mean to get into a real relationship with her. He leaves her and goes away. She gets shocked and commits suicide that night. Siddharth gets to know that it was because of his scolding that she committed suicide. From then on, he doesn't get involved with girls.\nTanu's story- Siddharth narrates his experience with Tanu to his friend who advises him not to leave her as he liked her. He goes back to her house to find that she has left for Singapore.\nThat is when he leaves for Singapore and meets Adi on the plane. When they reach Singapore, Adi invites him to live in his house. Siddharth then sets out to find Tanu. Adi invites Siddharth to his wedding. When Siddharth reaches there, he is shocked to see that the bride is Tanu. Without informing Adi, he leaves the marriage hall and goes to the airport. On the way, he calls Adi, and tells him that he has found Tanu, and he requests Adi to not disclose the incident which he narrated to him. Adi agrees.\nThen the credits start rolling.\n________________________________\nStarring - Sudeep, Ramya\nMusic - Raghu Dixit\nLyrics-\tRaghu Dixit,Manojav Galgali,Nandish Chandra,Raghavendra Kamath,Sudhir Attavar, Kiran S Vipra,\nDirector -Sudeep\nProducer -R.
