This collection also features insightful bios and personal memories of each artist from the likes of Anthony DeCurtis, Robert Palmer, Barry Hannah and even Iggy Pop. Disc one features the haunting, harrowing music of older bluesmen such as Junior Kimbrough, T-Model Ford, Solomon Burke, Mississippi Fred McDowell and Robert Pete Williams, among others. And while it's primarily the older black artists from Mississippi that are featured on this rough-hewed disc, it also incorporates some of the label's newer white artists, such as Bob Log III, Kenny Brown and 20 Miles, which only proves you don't have to be a black sharecropper to have deep soul. Disc two features the eclectic, yet highly intoxicating shot-gun wedding of Mississippi bluesman R.L. Burnside's red, raw vocal growls and hypnotic guitar along with Mike E. Clark's hip-hop beats and turntable scratchings. While the seven never-before-released songs here aren't quite as exhilarating as Burnside's 1998 crossover hit album Come On In, they still reaffirm that the blues as a creative, artistic medium is far from staring down into its own grave.\n\nTrack List:\n\nDisc: 1 \n1.
