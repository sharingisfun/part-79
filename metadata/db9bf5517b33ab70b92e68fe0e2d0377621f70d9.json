Other than keeping his parents employed, however, Mr. Black's BLACK BOX has done nothing for 11-year-old Toe Thompson, who just wants to make a few friends...until a mysterious rainbow-colored rock falls from the sky, hits him in the head and changes everything. The Rainbow Rock does Mr. Black's BLACK BOX one better: it grants wishes to anyone who holds it. Before long, wishes-gone-wrong have left the neighborhood swarming with tiny spaceships, crocodile armies, giant boogers...and outrageous magical mayhem around every corner.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db9bf5517b33ab70b92e68fe0e2d0377621f70d9","amp;dn":"Shorts+XviD+TS-Fatal+%5BNORARS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db9bf5517b33ab70b92e68fe0e2d0377621f70d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,155,245,81,123,51,171,112,185,46,104,254,14,45,3,119,98,31,112,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
