Most of the film consists \nof clips from Dean's three starring pictures (East of Eden, Rebel \nWithout a Cause and Giant), with tantalizing glimpses of his pre-star career. \nOne such glimpse, a snippet from the 1951 TV religious special Hill \nNumber One, has popped up in virtually every Dean retrospective since. \nAltman's inherent cinematic gifts are evident in the impressionistic \n&quot;re-enactment&quot; of Dean's fatal auto crash. Narrated by Martin Gabel, \nThe James Dean Story isn't terribly deep, but it's a good shorthand \noverview of one of the most powerful screen presences of the 1950s.\n\nIMDB-link......: http://imdb.com/title/tt0050558/\nYear.............: 1957\nCountry..........: AMERICA\nAudio............: English\nSubtitles........: None\nVideo Format.....: 4:3\nDVD Source.......: dvd5\nDVD Format.......: ntsc\nDVD distributor..: Double D Distribution\nProgram..........: dvd shrink\n\nMenus..........: Untouched, intact.\n           \n\nVideo..........: Untouched, intact.\n          \n\nDVD-extras.....:  None\n\n\nDVD-Audio......: Untouched, intact.\n\n\nthanks goes to davidhume","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b384a93fa5695a3c193f37f4006ef0768979390","amp;dn":"THE+JAMES+DEAN+STORY+%281957%29+-+DVD5+-+NTSC+-VIDEO_TS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b384a93fa5695a3c193f37f4006ef0768979390","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,56,74,147,250,86,149,163,193,147,243,127,64,6,239,7,104,151,147,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
