ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBound by PromisesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ tells the story of men who set out in search of work and are taken to isolated ranches in the Amazon, only to find that they have been lured into debt bondage. Forced to do backbreaking work and live in overcrowded shacks with no running water, armed guards remind the workers that those who try to run away may be killed. With no way out, they toil in the hope of buying back their freedom.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a092c77cf92d08893e5560efeca717ac84825427","amp;dn":"Aprisionados+por+Promessas+-+Bound+by+Promises+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a092c77cf92d08893e5560efeca717ac84825427","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,146,199,124,249,45,8,137,62,85,96,239,236,167,23,172,132,130,84,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
