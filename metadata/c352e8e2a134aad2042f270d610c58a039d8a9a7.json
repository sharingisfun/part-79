Coppola paints a chilling portrait of a Sicilian family's rise and near fall from power in America, and the passage of rites from a father to a son who was previously uninvolved in the business.\n\nGodfather Part II: (1974)\nThe Godfather Part II is one of the rare breed of cinematic sequels which is as good as, and perhaps better than, the original. Al Pacino heads the star cast as Michael Corleone, heir to the criminal empire established by his Mafioso father, the late Don Corleone.\n\nMichael is now in charge of all gambling activities in Nevada, making certain that any and all political or mob enemies are quickly bought off, compromised, or disposed of. Throughout the film, Michael's travails are paralleled with the early experiences of his father, played in flashbacks by Robert DeNiro.\n\nThe Godfather III: (1990)\nIn the final instalment of the Godfather Trilogy, an aging Don Michael Corleone seeks to legitimise his crime family's interests and remove himself from the violent underworld.\n\nNow in his sixties, Michael is dominated by two passions: freeing his family from crime, and finding a suitable successor. That successor could be fiery Vincent (Andy Garcia)... but he may also be the spark that turns Michael's hopes of business legitimacy into an inferno of mob violence.\n\n\ndetails for the 2 supplement discs\n\ndisc 4 [full rip]\n\nDisc #4 -- The Godfather: The 2001 Archival Supplements\nSpecial Features\nGodfather World\nThe Masterpiece That Almost Wasn't\n...When the Shooting Stopped\nEmulsional Rescue Revealing the Godfather\nThe Godfather On the Red Carpet\nFour Short Films On the Godfather\nGF vs. GF Part II\nRiffing On the Riffing\nCannoli\nClemenza\nPlay All\n2008 Credits\nSet Up\nSubtitle Options: English\nSubtitle Options: FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ais\nSubtitle Options: EspaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ol\nSubtitle Options: None\n\ndisc 5[full rip]\n\nDisc #5 -- The Godfather: All-New 2008 Supplements\nBehind the Scenes\nA Look Inside\nOn Location\nFrancis Coppola's Notebook\nMusic of the Godfather\nNino Rota\nCarmine Coppola\nCoppola &amp; Puzo On Screenwriting\nGordon Willis On Cinematography\nStoryboards: Godfather Part II\nStoryboards: Godfather Part III\nThe Godfather Behind the Scenes 1971\nFilmmakers\nFrancis Ford Coppola\nMario Puzo\nGordon Willis\nDean Tavoularis\nNino Rota\nCarmine Coppola\nAdditional Scenes\n1892-1930\n1931-1945\n1946-1955\n1956-1997\nScenes (1901-1927)\nSearching for Vito\nFanucci Attacked\nClemenza: &quot;I'm My Own Boss&quot;\nPlaying the Flute\nDiscussing Fanucci\nReasoning With Signor Roberto\nDon Vito Corleone\nIntroducing Hyman Roth\nVito's Revenge\nScenes (1945)\nThe Death of Genco\nA Gift From Woltz\nHagen Sees Janie\nA Family Fight\nMichael and Kay in Bed\nThe Don's Been Shot...\nSonny Absorbs the News\nMichael Gets Involved\nPlanning Paulie's Death\nClemenza Eats Lunch\nScenes (1947-1955)\nCommunist Demonstration\nSeeking Vito's House\nYelling in the Shower\n&quot;Bring Me Fabrizio&quot;\nTalking in the Garden\nHagen: &quot;Why Am I Out?&quot;\nKay Lights Candles\nScenes (1958-1979)\nFredo and Deanna\nNo Champagne Cocktails..\nFrancesca to Marry\nFrabrizio Located\nAnthony and Pentangeli\nNeri Humiliates Klingman\nMurder of Fabrizio\nGodfather III Alternate Opening\nGalleries\nTrailers\nThe Godfather\nThe Godfather Part II\nThe Godfather Part III\nPhoto Gallery\nAcclaim &amp; Response\nThe Godfather, Best Screenplay 1972\nThe Godfather, Best Picture 1972\nThe Godfather Part II, Best Director 1974\nThe Godfather Part II, Best Picture 1974\nAwards and Nominations\n1974 Network TV Intro\nRogues' Gallery\nDVD Credits\nThe Family Tree\nMichael 1920-1997\nAnthony 1951 -\nMary 1953 - 1979\nApollonia 1931 - 1947\nMichael 1920 - 1997\nKay Adams 1924 -\nConstanzia (Connie) 1927-\nVictor 1949 -\nMichael Francis 1954 -\nConstanzia (Connie) 1927 -\nCarlo Rizzia ? - 1955\nTom Hagen 1910-197?\nFrank 1940 -\nAndrew 1942 -\nTwo Daughters\nTom Hagen 1910 - 197?\nTheresa 1920 -\nVito Corleone: 1892-1954\nJohnny Fontane\nCarmella 1897 - 1959\nVito Corleone nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Andolini 1892 - 1954\nPaolo Andolini 1887 - 1901\nAntonio Andolini ? - 1901\nMother ? - 1901\nFrederico (Fredo) 1919-1959\nDeanna Dunn\nFrederico (Fredo) 1919-1959\nSantino (Sonny) 1916-1948\nFrank 1940 -\nFrancesca &amp; Kathryn 1937 -\nSantino Jr. 1945 -\nSandra\nSantino (Sonny) 1916-1948\nVincent 1948 -\nLucy Mancini\nSet Up\nSubtitle Selection: English\nSubtitle Selection: French\nSubtitle Selection: None\nHidden Feature","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c352e8e2a134aad2042f270d610c58a039d8a9a7","amp;dn":"THE+GODFATHER+COLLECTION-COPPOLAS+RESTORATION-2008-+5+DISC+BOXSE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c352e8e2a134aad2042f270d610c58a039d8a9a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,82,232,226,161,52,170,210,4,47,39,13,97,12,88,160,57,216,169,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
