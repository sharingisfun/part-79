As an activist historian he is best known for his book- George Bush: The Unauthorized Biography (1992), a masterpiece of research which is still a must read. He is a 9/11 Truth Scholar and activist; AB Princeton 1966, summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa; Fulbright Scholar at University of Turin, Italy; and MA in humanities from Skidmore College. He is fluent in Italian, German, French, Latin and Russian. A decades-long expert on international terrorism, his 1978 study for the Italian parliament &quot;Chi ha ucciso Aldo Moro?&quot;(Who Killed Aldo Moro?) broke open the ownership of the &quot;Red Brigades&quot; by NATO's clandestine &quot;stay-behind&quot; networks. \n\nMore recently author of Obama The Postmodern Coup, Barack H Obama The Unauthorised Biography and Surviving the Cataclysm.\n               &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tarpley.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tarpley.net&lt;/a&gt;           &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.progressivepress.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.progressivepress.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\n32K VBR MP3\n\nApprox. 1h20m with commercial edit.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:348a5a71bc3ded04e616b1aed76093be41f249d0","amp;dn":"World+Crisis+Radio+-+Webster+Tarpley+-+24+Oct+09.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"348a5a71bc3ded04e616b1aed76093be41f249d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,138,90,113,188,61,237,4,230,22,177,174,215,96,147,190,65,242,73,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
