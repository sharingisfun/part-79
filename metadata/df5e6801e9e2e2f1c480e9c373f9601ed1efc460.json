The children had fun with the pinata!\n\n(pictured above, bottom-left photo) Dancing!!\n\n\n\nYou may use the web download option (below) for web seeding.\n\n\n\nI just released the video from the Committee In Solidarity with the People of El Salvador (CISPES) 13th National convention held right here in Seattle, USA.\n\nNote: This is only the &quot;public&quot; event. I was not able to videotape the non-public events. Too bad, I am sure they were AWESOME!!!\n\nThis is the complete, uncut video. I was going to edit it a bit, but I didn't want to censor the event with my perspective of what should be shown. There is a web download option listed below, where you can stream this video. Please only use that for previewing. If you want to see the whole video, please use the torrent.\n\nYou will find a similar CISPES sponsored conference where I was able to videotape most of the event. The Eva Golinger and Martin Sanchez videos are the ones.  See my username link above tor those.\n\nThe Eva Golinger videos are two separate videos. There is Eva speaking at a podium and then she is also featured on a panel. The RAW video is also Kopimi, but is only raw video straight from the tape with no editing.\n\nI am releasing all of the material that I videotape myself under the Kopimi license! \n\nI even include a Kopimi slide at the beginning and/or end of all of my videos, and refer people to the Piratebyran.org website in my videos!\n\nI was actually a bit hesitant at first about releasing my material under that license, but considering what I was releasing, how could I not release under Kopimi rules?? This is what everyone must know! If I restrict this information by copyright limitations, then I would be restricting the flow of the information its self!!! Information should be FREE!!

Wars will be stopped only when soldiers refuse to fight, when workers refuse to load weapons onto ships and aircraft, when people boycott the economic outposts of Empire that are strung across the globe. &quot;\n-- Arundhati Roy, Public Power in the Age of Empire\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56559403&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56559403&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n---\n\n&quot;Many people do not have sufficient confidence in themselves, their judgment and their capacities to make them capable of disobedience and resistance. Having no strong will of their own, they accept that of their rulers, and sometimes prefer rulers who will direct their lives and relieve them of the task of making decisions. The subjects may be disillusioned, exhausted, apathetic, or possessed of inertia, or they may lack a belief system which makes it possible both to evaluate when one ought to obey and disobey, and also to give confidence in one's right and ability to make such a decision. Lack of self-confidence may also be influenced by a belief that the ruling group is more qualified to make decisions and to carry them out than are the subjects. This attitude may be based on perceived greater competence, social customs and class distinctions, or conscious indoctrination.&quot;\n-- Gene Sharp, Power and Struggle, Part One of The Politics of Nonviolent Action, 1973\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.worldcat.org/oclc/21051113&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.worldcat.org/oclc/21051113&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n---\n\n&quot;No free man shall be taken, imprisoned, disseised, outlawed, banished, or in any way destroyed, not will we proceed against or prosecute him, except by the lawful judgment of his peers and by the law of the land.&quot;\n-- Magna Carta, an 800 year old document\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n---\n\n&quot;It may well be a question, whether these are not, upon the whole, of equal importance with any which are to be found in the constitution of this State. The establishment of the writ of habeas corpus, the prohibition of ex post facto laws, and of TITLES OF NOBILITY, to which we have no corresponding provision in our Constitution, are perhaps greater securities to liberty and republicanism than any it contains. The creation of crimes after the commission of the fact,or, in other words, the subjecting of men to punishment for things which, when they were done, were breaches of no law, and the practice of arbitrary imprisonments, have been, in all ages, the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny. The observations of the judicious Blackstone,1 in reference to the latter,are well worthy of recital:\n\n\n&quot; 'To bereave a man of life,' says he, 'or by violence to confiscate his estate, without accusation or trial, would be so gross and notorious an act of despotism, as must at once convey the alarm of tyranny throughout the whole nation; but confinement of the person, by secretly hurrying him to jail, where his sufferings are unknown or forgotten, is a less public, a less striking, and therefore a more dangerous engine of arbitrary government.&quot; And as a remedy for this fatal evil he is everywhere peculiarly emphatical in his encomiums on the habeas corpus act, which in one place he calls &quot;the BULWARK of the British Constitution.&quot;2\n\n--  Alexander Hamilton, Federalist 84\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.constitution.org/fed/federa84.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.constitution.org/fed/federa84.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n---\n\n** Members of Congress should be compelled to wear uniforms like NASCAR drivers, so we could identify their corporate sponsors.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df5e6801e9e2e2f1c480e9c373f9601ed1efc460","amp;dn":"CISPES+National+Convention+2009+Seattle+Salvadoran+Day+Fiesta","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df5e6801e9e2e2f1c480e9c373f9601ed1efc460","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,94,104,1,233,226,226,241,196,128,233,195,115,249,96,30,209,239,196,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
