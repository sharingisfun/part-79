Like all of the inhabitants of this carefully controlled environment, Lincoln hopes to be chosen to go to the &quot;The Island&quot; - reportedly the last uncontaminated spot on the planet. But Lincoln soon discovers that everything about his existence is a lie. He and all of the other inhabitants of the facility are actually human clones. Lincoln makes a daring escape with a beautiful fellow resident named Jordan Two-Delta. Relentlessly pursued by the forces of the sinister institute that once housed them, Lincoln and Jordan engage in a race for their lives to literally meet their makers.\n\nCast:\nEwan McGregor ...
