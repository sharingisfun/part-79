The latest version now incorporates CPRxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ technology to \nensure the highest level of success copying the latest generation of DVD movies. \nYou now have complete control over the final copy. Use the Copy PresetsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ or the \nmore advanced features to select what content will be copied and how much \ncompression will be used. \n\nWith 1CLICK DVD COPY - PRO, you can make a perfect copy with just one click. \nCPRx is a unique and innovative solution to copy new DVD movies which contain bad \nsectors or bad DVD structure. Many popular DVD movies are now created in such a \nway as to make it difficult for backup software to copy them properly. This can \nresult in errors during the copy process, or bad playback after the copy is \ncompleted. In order to copy a DVD which has been authored using these new schemes, \n1CLICK DVD COPY now utilizes state of the art CPRx technology to ensure the \nhighest level of success when making an archival backup. \n\nJust as we've become accustomed to relying on anti-virus software to keep us \nprotected against the latest viruses, we must also rely on new updates of CPRx to \nensure we can copy the latest DVD releases. With 1CLICK's update notification \nfeature, you can rest assured that you will be notified every time a new version \nof the software is available.\n\n\n\nFeatures of 1Click DVD Copy Pro:\n\n- Windows Vista Compatible \n- CPRxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ technology for copying new DVD movies. \n- Copy PresetsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ - One click preset for each type of DVD copy. \n- Preview the movie, extras and menus. \n- Include or exclude movie and menus based on preview. \n- Select individual audio, video, and subtitles streams. \n- Control the amount of video compression used. \n- Make additional backup copies without re-copying the DVD. \n- Copy Episodic DVD Movies, TV Series, etc. \n- Copy a movie to your hard drive - great for laptops. \n- Supports copying of Multi-Channel Audio (Dolby Digital 5.1, DTS). \n- Supports both NTSC and PAL DVD movies. \n- Supports Dual Layer media. \n- Free software updates and technical support for a year.\n\n\n\nChanges in 1Click DVD Copy Pro 4.0.4.0 (July 23, 2009):\n\n* Updated: Cprx updated for movies like &quot;One Week&quot; - the wrong title was \n  selected when the &quot;Movie Only&quot; option is enabled.\n* Fixed: Burning engine would generate an assertion error in some special cases.\n\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\n- Compatible with Windows 7, Vista, XP, 2000, Me or 98SE.\n\n\n\nMore info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.lgsoftwareinnovations.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.lgsoftwareinnovations.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;When using TPB please read these important notes: \n****************************************************\n\n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of \n    their capabilities (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not trusting \n    keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting antimalware-apps sending scanning-results to their companies can coz\n    keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n06- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n10- Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?f=34&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?f=34&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting &quot;TPB's Most Ridiculous Comments&quot;:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=30402&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=30402&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my account*:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n*All torrents scanned with:\n1- Norton Internet Security  \n2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  \n3- AVG Antivirus Pro   \n4- Kaspersky AV Pro  \n5- NOD32 AV  \n\n...and also with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected by \n   other anti-malware apps probably are false positives!\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of PB members abuse their PB membership by intenionally posting \nfake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to \nfrustrate PB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less \ndownloadspeed etc etc. \n\nIt's in the benefit of PB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and PB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\n                                         \n* Status torrent at aug, 02 2009 - 03.45 CET: clean, tested &amp; working.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdaa3c22af1d292d399699a919d1e65761cb4eb4","amp;dn":"1Click+DVD+Copy+Pro+v4.0.4.0+%2B+Patch+%5BRH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdaa3c22af1d292d399699a919d1e65761cb4eb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,170,60,34,175,29,41,45,57,150,153,169,25,209,230,87,97,203,78,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
