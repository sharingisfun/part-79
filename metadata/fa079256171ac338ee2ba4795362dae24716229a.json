This 103-track box set features all of Bonnie's recordings between 1953 and 1970.\n\nThis well-assembled four-CD box set compiles some of the best moments of the career of Bonnie Owens, the artist to be forever known as the woman who married (and divorced) both Buck Owens and Merle Haggard. The female voice of the Bakersfield sound and a true country music archetype, Owens provided a forthright counterpoint to the rollicking antics of the music's male stars with her performances of such songs as &quot;Too Used to Being With You,&quot; &quot;I Wish I Felt This Way at Home,&quot; and Haggard's &quot;You Don't Have Very Far to Go.&quot;\n\nBear Family Records.
