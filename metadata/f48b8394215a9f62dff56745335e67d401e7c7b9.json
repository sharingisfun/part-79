It happened in Amityville, and it's happening in Plymouth, Mass.\n\nThirty years ago, John and Pauline Grzelak moved into a house that seemed to have permanent residents. Recently, the spirits have turned mean- one shadow even punched a relative in the stomach! The family has seen several shadows, a woman in red, orbs of light, a little girl walking around and Pauline reported a woman putting extreme pressure on her chest as she was sleeping.\n\n\nPauline is frightened to the point that she wants to leave her home. The team is definitely anxious to get in and help this family out so they can be at peace in their home.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f48b8394215a9f62dff56745335e67d401e7c7b9","amp;dn":"Ghost.Hunters.S06E07.HDTV.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f48b8394215a9f62dff56745335e67d401e7c7b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,139,131,148,33,90,159,98,223,245,103,69,51,94,103,212,1,231,199,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
