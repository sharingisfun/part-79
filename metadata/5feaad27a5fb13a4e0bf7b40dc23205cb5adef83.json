After ten years together Charlie Mansell has been dumped by his live-in girlfriend, Sarah. All he wants to do is wallow in misery, but mates Andy and Tom have a better idea: a week of sun, sea and souvlaki in Malia -- party capital of the Greek islands. But Charlie and his mates aren't eighteen any more. Or even under thirty. And it shows. It isn't the cheap beer, the late nights or even the fast-food that's the problem. It's girls. And life. And most of all ...each other. Wish You Were Here is a heart-warming, funny and wise tale about love and friendship and how seven days in the sun can change your life forever. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5feaad27a5fb13a4e0bf7b40dc23205cb5adef83","amp;dn":"Wish+You+Were+Here+by+Mike+Gayle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5feaad27a5fb13a4e0bf7b40dc23205cb5adef83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,234,173,39,165,251,19,164,224,191,123,64,220,35,32,92,181,173,239,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
