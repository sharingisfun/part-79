When one of his former          \n colleagues is murdered, the washed up but no less determined masked          \n vigilante Rorschach sets out to uncover a plot to kill and discredit all     \n past and present superheroes. As he reconnects with his former               \n crime-fighting legion - a ragtag group of retired superheroes, only one of   \n whom has true powers - Rorschach glimpses a wide-ranging and disturbing      \n conspiracy with links to their shared past and catastrophic consequences     \n for the future. Their mission is to watch over humanity... but who is        \n watching the Watchmen?&quot;                                                      \n                                                                              \n\n\n                           Happy Hacker Industries                            \nThis movie should play fine on most DVD/DivX Certified settop\ndvd players.
