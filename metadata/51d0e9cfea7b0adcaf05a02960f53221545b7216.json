The game doesn't offer much to the simulation freak, but if you're looking for a simple race-around-a-track game with fast smooth graphics, then this might be just right for you. The controls seem to get a bit too responsive on faster computers. If you're having trouble staying on course, try a slow-down util for Windows, like Turbo. Note: This Windows game only works in 256 color mode, so make sure you reset desktop settings before starting the game.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51d0e9cfea7b0adcaf05a02960f53221545b7216","amp;dn":"Al.Unser.Jr.Arcade.Racing.%281995%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51d0e9cfea7b0adcaf05a02960f53221545b7216","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,208,233,207,234,123,10,220,175,5,160,41,96,245,50,33,84,91,114,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
