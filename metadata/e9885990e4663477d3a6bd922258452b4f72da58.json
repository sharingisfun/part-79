It is similar, although unrelated, to Band of Brothers. Whereas Band of Brothers focused on the United States Army's involvement in the European Theater of Operations, the new series will be about United States Marine Corps's actions in the Pacific Theater of Operations. The Pacific is being spearheaded by Bruce McKenna (co-executive producer), who was one of the main writers on Band of Brothers. Hugh Ambrose, the son of Band of Brothers author Stephen Ambrose, will serve as a project consultant. The Pacific is being produced by Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and Gary Goetzman in association with HBO Films, Playtone, Dreamworks, and Seven Network. Seven invested in the project for the right to broadcast it in Australia. Nine Network has previously broadcast the HBO productions of The Sopranos and Band of Brothers. Nine had a broadcast deal with HBO's parent Warner Bros., but then HBO started to distribute its own productions separately.\n\nVideo details\nResolution : 1920x1080 (16:9)\nVideo Codec : MPEG2\nBitrate : 10752 kbps\nAudio : English AC-3 5.1 @ 384kbps\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1576604/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1576604/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tv.com/the-pacific/show/76289/summary.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tv.com/the-pacific/show/76289/summary.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9885990e4663477d3a6bd922258452b4f72da58","amp;dn":"The+Pacific+Part+9+1080i+HDTV+DD5.1+MPEG2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9885990e4663477d3a6bd922258452b4f72da58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,136,89,144,228,102,52,119,211,166,189,146,34,88,69,43,79,114,218,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
