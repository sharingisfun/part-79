Joining up with Daytime's former drummer, Lenny Querques and Daytime's current bassist, Mike Bickford they began to formulate their music. Over a year's worth of hard work and dedication, left them with a six song EP (Demoura), a track record of gigs and shows, and a gradually growing fan base. Their accomplishments were piled high for a band so new, playing at New Jersey venues that included; The Stone Pony, The Brighton Bar, The Saint, Bar A, Cafe 55 and Rick's American Cafe.
