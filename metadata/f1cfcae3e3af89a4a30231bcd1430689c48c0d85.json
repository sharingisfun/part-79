(It probably works with other &quot;MP4-players&quot; too)\n\nScrubs is an American comedy-drama television series created in 2001 by Bill Lawrence and produced by ABC Studios. The show follows the lives of several employees of Sacred Heart, a teaching hospital. It features fast-paced screenplay, slapstick, and surreal vignettes presented mostly as the daydreams of the central character, Dr. John &quot;J.D.&quot; Dorian, who is played by Zach Braff. The ninth season saw the transition from Braff as the central character to Kerry BishÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, who plays Lucy Bennett. The show's title is a play on surgical scrubs and a term for a low-ranking or insignificant person (at the beginning of the show, most of the main characters were medical interns, one of the lowest ranks in the medical hierarchy).\n\nAlongside Braff, the first eight seasons of the show feature Sarah Chalke, Donald Faison, Neil Flynn, Ken Jenkins, John C. McGinley and Judy Reyes in starring roles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1cfcae3e3af89a4a30231bcd1430689c48c0d85","amp;dn":"Scrubs+Season+8+%28iPod+Touch+%26+iPhone%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1cfcae3e3af89a4a30231bcd1430689c48c0d85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,207,202,227,227,175,137,164,163,2,49,188,209,67,6,137,196,140,13,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
