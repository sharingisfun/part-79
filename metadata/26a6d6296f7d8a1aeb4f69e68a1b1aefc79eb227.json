And in what could be viewed as a victory for progressives and labor, Sen. Blanche Lincoln has been forced into a June 8 runoff in Arkansas.\n\nIn the PA race that actually pitted a Democrat and against a Republican, and was considered a bellwether for the November midterms, Dem. Mark Critz wins easily, keeping John MurthaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s district blue despite it voting for McCain in 2008.\n\nRepublican Rep. Mark Souder of IndianaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s affair with a staffer (resignation video) is just the latest in a long list of scandals involving the 1994 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œContract for AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ class of Republicans. And in a bitter twist of irony, Souder is seen here being ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œinterviewedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by his mistress/staffer on abstinence-only education.\n\nA scandal of a different stripe has emerged for Democrat Richard Blumenthal in Connecticut. While the conventional wisdom is that Blumenthal will survive the fallout over misleading people into believing that he fought in Vietnam, the question is should he?\n\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court rules that Congress has the authority to keep sexually violent and mentally ill offenders detained beyond their sentences if the government can convince a judge that they are still a danger or a state assume responsibility - as Solicitor General, Elena Kagan argued the case and won.  The Supremes also ruled that juveniles cannot be sentenced to life without possibility of parole for crimes in which no one is killed.\n\nAlso, the Gulf spill has reached Louisiana marshland and an Alabama teacher is investigated after using the hypothetical shooting of President Obama as a geometry lesson.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26a6d6296f7d8a1aeb4f69e68a1b1aefc79eb227","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+May+19+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26a6d6296f7d8a1aeb4f69e68a1b1aefc79eb227","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,166,214,41,111,125,138,26,235,79,105,230,138,27,26,239,199,158,178,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
