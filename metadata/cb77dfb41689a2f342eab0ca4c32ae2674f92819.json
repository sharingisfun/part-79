All varies only when you will open Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â³Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â»Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â·Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°&quot;. This carefully thought over film is constructed as though of slices of a mosaic which gradually rise on the places. \n\nVery beautiful young guy Sezar (Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€˜Ã…â€™Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â³Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°), inherited a decent fortune from the father owning a network of restaurants, is engaged two months with the psychiatrist.

This episode has huge value for understanding of a film. Next morning at the house of Sofia Sezara meets Nurija in the magnificent red car. She offers Sezaru drugs. That refuses, and it accepts some tablets because wishes to be always with it nearby. She asks it, whether he trusts in God, and then at great speed moves down from a motorway and runs into a wall. The reality forks. In one - Sezar - the ugly creature angered on the verge of madness, compelled to be masked, not capable to adapt for a life in a new condition, and in another - it continues to meet Sofia, is young and still beautiful. Whether but real it is a life? Perhaps, it only a dream of the consciousness frozen by means of cryogenic engineering?.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb77dfb41689a2f342eab0ca4c32ae2674f92819","amp;dn":"Open+eyes+%28DVD-Rip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb77dfb41689a2f342eab0ca4c32ae2674f92819","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,119,223,180,22,137,162,243,66,234,176,202,76,50,174,38,116,249,40,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
