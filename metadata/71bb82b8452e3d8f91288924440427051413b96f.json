Eija Okada plays an amateur entomologist who has left Tokyo to study an unclassified species of beetle that resides in a remote, vast desert; when he misses his bus back to civilization, he is persuaded to spend the night in the home of a young widow (Kiyoko Kishida) who lives in a hut at the bottom of a sand dune. What results is one of cinemaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most bristling, unnerving, and palpably erotic battles of the sexes, as well as a nightmarish depiction of everyday Sisyphean struggle, for which Teshigahara received an Academy Award nomination for best director.\n\n\nCast\nJunpei Niki........: Eiji Okada\nThe woman..........: Kyoko Kishida\n\nCredits\nDirector...........: Hiroshi Teshigahara\nFrom the story by..: KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´bÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´ Abe\nProducer...........: Kiichi Ichikawa and Tadashi Ono\nCinematography.....: Hiroshi Segawa\nMusic..............: Toru Takemitsu\nArt direction......: Totetsu Hirakawa and Masao Yamazaki\nEditing............: Fusako Shuzui\n\n\n\nDVDBeaver link: http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film2/DVDReviews32/three_films_hiroshi_teshigahara.htm\n\n\nAll credit goes to the original uploader at Cinematik, Moltar.\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71bb82b8452e3d8f91288924440427051413b96f","amp;dn":"Suna+no+onna+%28Woman+in+the+Dunes%29+-+Hiroshi+Teshigahara+-+1964","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71bb82b8452e3d8f91288924440427051413b96f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,187,130,184,69,46,61,143,145,40,137,36,68,4,39,5,20,19,185,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
