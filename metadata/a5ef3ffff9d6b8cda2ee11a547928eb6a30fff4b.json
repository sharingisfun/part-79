King Diamond's first three solo releases, 1986's Fatal Portrait, 1987's Abigail, and 1988's Them, are widely considered to be Diamond's finest, as the singer continued to issue further releases until the early '90s (1989's Conspiracy, 1990's The Eye).\n\nTHIS TORRENT HAS ONLY THE \n&quot;THEM&quot; AND &quot;CONSPIRACY&quot; ALBUMS BUT I HAVE ADDED THE LYRICS AS AN ADDED BONUS IN WORD FORMAT.\n\nENJOY\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5ef3ffff9d6b8cda2ee11a547928eb6a30fff4b","amp;dn":"King+Diamond","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5ef3ffff9d6b8cda2ee11a547928eb6a30fff4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,239,63,255,249,214,184,205,162,238,17,165,71,146,142,182,163,15,255,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
