Each child has a hearing twin with whom their language development is compared. This insightful 30-minute documentary provides a dramatic demonstration of the power of the cochlear implant, which has been the cause of much controversy and misunderstanding with the signing Deaf community. By following the lives of the twins and their families, one of which is featured in our film SOUND AND FURY, we witness the astonishing growth in the deaf children's speech and hearing as well as their integration and assimilation into mainstream life.\n\nHas non-removable closed captioning.\n\nPlease help seed, and comments are appreciated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eafaaf07c18d80c73e8d93aeaa1589a18c32ee4b","amp;dn":"Twins%3A+A+Cochlear+Implant+Story+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eafaaf07c18d80c73e8d93aeaa1589a18c32ee4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,250,175,7,193,141,128,199,62,141,147,174,170,21,137,161,140,50,238,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
