The song became Parton's second solo number-one single on the country charts after being released as a single in late 1973 (prior to the album's release). It reached the top position in February 1974; it also was a moderate pop hit for her and a minor adult contemporary chart entry, and was released as a single in the UK the following year, where it reached number seven in the UK singles chart.\n\nParton has said that the inspiration for the story was a tall, red-headed bank teller who Parton believed was flirting with her husband, and her husband's apparent vulnerability to the teller's charm as indicated by his sudden interest in making frequent trips to the bank. In her live performances of the song, Dolly often states she fought this woman tooth and nail for her husband. The name &quot;Jolene&quot; came from a beautiful little red-headed girl with green eyes who sought her autograph at a concert.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ I said, what is your name? And she said, Jolene. And I said, well, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene. I said, that is pretty, I said, that sounds like a song. I'm going to write a song about that. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3ee84525d3bec34d07c397136743c3375085a8f","amp;dn":"Olivia+Newton-John+-+Jolene+%5B1976%5D.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3ee84525d3bec34d07c397136743c3375085a8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,238,132,82,93,59,236,52,208,124,57,113,54,116,60,51,117,8,90,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
