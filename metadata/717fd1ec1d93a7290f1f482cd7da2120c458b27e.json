The films in the series are motivated by a central theme: how the blues evolved from parochial folk tunes to a universal language.\n\n\nThe Blues - Piano Blues (Xvid)[m4ndr4]\n\nDirector ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and piano player ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Clint Eastwood (Play Misty for Me, Bird, Unforgiven) explores his life-long passion for piano blues, using a treasure trove of rare historical footage in addition to interviews and performances by such living legends as Pinetop Perkins and Jay McShann, as well as Dave Brubeck and Marcia Ball.\n\nSays Eastwood: &quot;The blues has always been part of my musical life and the piano has a special place, beginning when my mother brought home all of Fats Waller's records. Also, the music has always played a part in my movies. A piano blues documentary gives me a chance to make a film that is more directly connected to the subject of the music than the features that I have been doing throughout my career.&quot;\n\nPerformances\n\nMarcia Ball\nDave Brubeck\nRay Charles Jay McShann\nPinetop Perkins\nand many more!\n\nTechInfo\n\nVideo............Xvid 1161 Kbps 656x368 (16/9) 25.000 fps \nAudio............MP3 256 kbps 48.0 KHz (2 chnls)\nRuntime..........01:28:12\n\nHomepage: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/theblues/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/theblues/index.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:717fd1ec1d93a7290f1f482cd7da2120c458b27e","amp;dn":"The+Blues+-+Piano+Blues+%28Xvid%29++%5Bm4ndr4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"717fd1ec1d93a7290f1f482cd7da2120c458b27e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,127,209,236,29,147,167,41,15,31,72,44,215,218,33,32,196,88,178,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
