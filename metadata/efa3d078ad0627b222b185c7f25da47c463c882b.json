Spanning six fifty minute episodes the DVD focuses on wildlife based on the many different landscapes of Australia, including the seas, rainforests, the desert, and the snowy south. \n\nBut that's not all, it also focuses on man's impact on the wildlife as well as taking you to see the wildlife present on New Zealand and the isolated islands east of the Australian coast. It's very likely this DVD will show you animals you've never seen or heard about, one of my favourites is the Lyre bird which imitates the other birds around it by using their songs as it's own! \n\nNarrated by Matt Day he takes you on an exciting and interesting journey of Australia with breathtaking views, stunning scenery and a great soundtrack to boot. It just wouldn't be the BBC without it! Definately a top download if you love unique nature.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efa3d078ad0627b222b185c7f25da47c463c882b","amp;dn":"Wild+Down+Under++-+Part+6+++%28BBC+2003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efa3d078ad0627b222b185c7f25da47c463c882b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,163,208,120,173,6,39,178,34,177,133,199,242,93,164,124,70,60,136,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
