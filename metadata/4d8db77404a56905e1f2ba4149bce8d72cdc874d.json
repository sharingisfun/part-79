Although the set isn't quite up to par with its predecessor, Obscure Alternatives is still a challenging listen. David Sylvian is snotty, snotty on &quot;Automatic Gun&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a spit-shined punk shocker backed by bright pop guitar ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and ironically playing into all the guises they eschewed. Both the wonderfully atmospheric and slightly menacing title track and &quot;Love Is Infectious&quot; put the band completely into discordant post-punk art house-dom, the latter including a twisted piano solo in the middle of the guitar crunch. &quot;....Rhodesia,&quot; on the other hand, brought the funk back and infused it with a Caribbean essence. While there is no doubt that Obscure Alternatives paled in the shadow of Adolescent Sex, Japan had obviously, in their eyes, broken through to find their style, their groove. Still eons away musically from their more commercial Tin Drum heyday, the band were nevertheless cultivating a breathtaking crop of kernels. &quot;\n\nNote to Sony-BMG Music Entertainment (UK/Europe): the next time you release another repackaged/expanded/copy-protected and supposedly 'digitally remastered' version of this album, or any other Japan compilation a) could you do us all a favour and master all titles from the actual master tapes - including the bonus tracks - as opposed to from vinyl or in some cases very obviously cassettes? b) could you then do us all a favour and use some sort of tape-hiss noise reduction? c) could you do us all a favour and make sure that there are no sound drop outs on any of the tracks? d) could you do us all a favour and make sure that all tracks really are in proper stereo as opposed to one side of the two-track mix spread across both channels? e) could you do us all a favour and make sure that you don't accidentally delete the opening bar to any of the tracks? f) could you do us all a favour and make sure that you don't accidentally delete parts of the vocals on one of the tracks? f) could you do us all a favour and make sure that you don't accidentally delete the drums/bass/guitars/synths etc. on any of the other tracks? g) could you do us all a favour and make sure that you don't 'accidentally' include the album version of a track twice and then label one of them as &quot;12&quot; Mix&quot;, &quot;Extended Version&quot;, &quot;New Edit&quot; or &quot;Remix&quot;? h) could you do us all a favour and make sure that the tracks, versions and mixes listed on the album cover also are those on the actual disc?
