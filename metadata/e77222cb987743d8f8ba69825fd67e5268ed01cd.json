A member and co-founder of the postpunk-band DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶dens Lammungar, also originating from Uppsala.\n\nGreat stuff, like a mixture of the sharp guitar sounds ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ Killing Joke, the metallic background associated with Rupert Hine as well as the crazyness in Bill Nelson's Red Sound, and on top if all, a perfect homage to the wonderful voice of Peter Murphy. Enjoy, this truly is a gem!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e77222cb987743d8f8ba69825fd67e5268ed01cd","amp;dn":"Frazzle+Compilation+-+Swedish+Postpunk+at+its+finest%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e77222cb987743d8f8ba69825fd67e5268ed01cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,114,34,203,152,119,67,216,248,186,105,130,95,214,126,82,104,237,1,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
