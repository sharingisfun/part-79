Reason being, the only way that you could obtain this CD is through ordering a vinyl record for $50, THEN buy a program + hardware (Spinitagain) for 35.99, THEN go through the trouble of setting it up, and transferring it to your computer, then burning it to a disk.\n\nSo, I'll upload the song here, and since I know most of you old Republicans today don't know how to operate a VCR, you can download it from the following link to your computer to add to a CD.\n\nDon't forget to remove the spaces; the download will be faster and direct from the below links.  I upload slowly, so it may take a day or two for the dong to fully reach you.  For this reason, I need seeders.\n\nREMOVE THE SPACES:\n\nr a p i d s h a r e . com/files/274536827/Track03.wav\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nI'll seed probably for a long time to come, so pickup on it only if you really want to.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15b6b02baf7a7c0ce874087de893d3112ed2ba1f","amp;dn":"Dan+Peek+Lonely+People+Christian+Version","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15b6b02baf7a7c0ce874087de893d3112ed2ba1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,182,176,43,175,122,124,12,232,116,8,125,232,147,211,17,46,210,186,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
