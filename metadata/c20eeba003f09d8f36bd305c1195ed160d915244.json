We're a basic punk band...not old school and not the new crap that we hear all the time (Melodic Hardcore, emo etc.). Basically we have an early 90's mid 90's sound.\n\nWe all met in High School except for our bassist who had to escape the pit that is Jersey...but I guess MD isn't much better. We've been playing for a few years and still suck but that's the way we like it.\n\n\nLocation: \tFrederick, MD United States\nFormed: \t1998\nInfluences: \tBouncing Souls, Social Distortion, NOFX, Vandals, AFI, Bigwig, Offspring, Ramones, Tom Petty\n\nAlbums:\n\nLeave It All Behind (2003)\nBurn (2003)\nJacob (The Donkey) (2008)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c20eeba003f09d8f36bd305c1195ed160d915244","amp;dn":"Stupyd+Cow+Discogrophy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c20eeba003f09d8f36bd305c1195ed160d915244","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,14,235,160,3,240,157,143,54,189,48,92,17,149,237,22,13,145,82,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
