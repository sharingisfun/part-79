It was originally hosted by Destiny, but was gradually taken over by Eve, who fully assumed the title with issue #15.\n\nEarly issues printed material by Jack Kirby that had been intended for his black and white, magazine-size DC comic, Spirit World, which lasted only one issue.  These stories featured Dr. E. Leopold Maas as host, sometimes with an appended hosting segment by Destiny.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a5a0b004cb9a3fa424dc8fd89b50f59ed90df16","amp;dn":"Weird+Mystery+Tales+%28DC+Comics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a5a0b004cb9a3fa424dc8fd89b50f59ed90df16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,90,11,0,76,185,163,250,66,77,200,253,137,181,15,89,237,144,223,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
