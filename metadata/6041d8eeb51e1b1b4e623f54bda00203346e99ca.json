Formed in London in 1989 as Seymour, the group consists of singer Damon Albarn, guitarist Graham Coxon, bassist Alex James and drummer Dave Rowntree. Blur's debut album Leisure (1991) incorporated the sounds of Madchester  and shoegazing. Following a stylistic changeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½influenced by English guitar pop groups such as The Kinks, The Beatles and XTCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Blur released the Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993), Parklife  (1994) and The Great Escape (1995) albums. As a result, the band helped to popularise the Britpop genre and achieved mass popularity in the UK, aided by a famous chart battle with rival band Oasis dubbed &quot;The Battle of Britpop&quot;.\n\n\n.ooOO ROSA MANNEN 2010 OOoo.\n                                                                                   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/RosaMannen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/RosaMannen&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6041d8eeb51e1b1b4e623f54bda00203346e99ca","amp;dn":"Blur+-+Mellow+Song+%28Live+BBC+Hippodrome%2C+London+1999%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6041d8eeb51e1b1b4e623f54bda00203346e99ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,65,216,238,181,30,27,27,78,98,63,84,189,160,2,3,52,110,153,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
