Guinsoo then passed version 6 of the map on to its current developer, Icefrog. Pendragon, who is the Director of Community Relations for Riot Games, helped create the previous DotA Allstars website along with its forums.\n\n\n\n  heres the registration link.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:130d6631548d7131e6efe4f6d10a95fdef56f864","amp;dn":"League+of+Legends%3AClash+of+Fates%28EU+server%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"130d6631548d7131e6efe4f6d10a95fdef56f864","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,13,102,49,84,141,113,49,230,239,228,246,209,10,149,253,239,86,248,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
