But they are thrust together when they witness a murder and become targets of a contract killer.\n\nFederal marshalls whisk away the Morgans from their beloved New York to tiny Ray, Wyoming, where they are temporarily put in the custody of the Wheelers (Sam Elliott and Mary Steenburgen), a married couple who are U.S. Marshals. They use the assumed names of Meryl and Paul Foster, who are visiting their cousins, the Wheelers. The killer, meanwhile, tries to track them down.\n\nWhile adjusting to Ray, Paul tries rekindling their marriage. Meanwhile, in New York, the killer is still after them and has found out where they are through Meryl's assistant. When Paul gets bear repellent sprayed in his eyes, he is taken to the only doctor in town, whose number the murderer intercepts.\n\nPaul and Meryl go on a &quot;date&quot; in town and begin to reconcile, but then Paul is alienated when he learns that Meryl had had an affair while they were separated.\n\nThe next day, with the killer in town, the Morgans anticipate leaving Ray for a permanent hiding place. The Wheelers invite them to a rodeo, but the Morgans are quarreling so they decline. Leaving the Morgans without any form of security, the Wheelers leave for the rodeo. The killer attacks the house, but the Morgans are able to sneak out.\n\nFleeing to the rodeo, they hide in a bull suit and accidentally frighten a live bull into head-butting them. Meryl, unable to walk, stays hidden from the killer while Paul confronts him unarmed. But he is rescued by Mr. and Mrs. Wheeler and his new friends from the town.\n\nIn a coda, set 6 months later, Paul and Meryl are still married having just adopted a baby girl from China, whom they name Rae after Ray, Wyoming, and Meryl is pregnant with a child of their own.\n[edit] Reception\n\n\nIMAGENES \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img404.imageshack.us/img404/5194/didyouhearaboutthemorgap.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img404.imageshack.us/img404/5194/didyouhearaboutthemorgap.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img517.imageshack.us/img517/2712/001io.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img517.imageshack.us/img517/2712/001io.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img404.imageshack.us/img404/5823/002zh.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img404.imageshack.us/img404/5823/002zh.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img256.imageshack.us/img256/3391/003qk.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img256.imageshack.us/img256/3391/003qk.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba495e2bd972148a75bfb8b63c31ae9928b9459c","amp;dn":"Did+you+hear+about+the+morgans+por+memitoxxx+etorrents.org+%28+ing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba495e2bd972148a75bfb8b63c31ae9928b9459c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,73,94,43,217,114,20,138,117,191,184,182,60,49,174,153,40,185,69,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
