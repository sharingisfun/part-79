Lee's amazing book AIDS in America - Our Chances, Our Choices - A Survival Guide (1987) which is probably the most documented study of the spread of AIDS in USA ever done. It's a realistic look at one of the major problems facing the United States today. The author has done a very thorough job of research on a controversial subject and has put into writing what many health care people have been saying. It is now time to protect the whole population and to look at the danger we are facing and to act as AIDS is a threat to us all. AIDS in America provides concrete facts and figures where others fail to do so as it examines the future of this deadly disease in America. Information about the scientific struggle, the potential magnitude of the disease, the social impact, and individual protection is presented with the objective not being that of sensationalism but instead a logical presentation of the potential catastrophe which may soon confront us all. 205 pages. A must read for everyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c326f95ac377bc4ce1e1100dcc4425a74d77909","amp;dn":"Lee-AIDS+in+America%28most+documented+study+of+AIDS%29%281987%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c326f95ac377bc4ce1e1100dcc4425a74d77909","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,50,111,149,172,55,123,196,206,30,17,0,220,196,66,90,116,215,121,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
