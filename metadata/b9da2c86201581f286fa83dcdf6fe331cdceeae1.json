It was released on 30 June 2010, just eight months after the release of their previous album, RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶d, but was released exclusively as digital download on the band's website on June 23. The album is produced primarily with the Swedish producer Stefan Boman, who worked with the band on Du &amp; jag dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶den from 2005. The lead single, &quot;Gamla Ullevi&quot; / &quot;Skisser fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶r sommaren&quot;, was released on 14 June 2010, the same day as the band announced the album details. En plats i solen has peaked at number one in Sweden, number twenty-four in Norway and number twenty-six in Denmark.\n\nThe album was written and recorded in the early spring of 2010, and was finished on June 8. Some of the songs are leftovers from the recording of RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶d. Lead singer Joakim Berg told Svenska Dagbladet that they wanted to record the songs &quot;while they were still fresh&quot;.\n\nTrack listing\n-------------\nAll lyrics written by Joakim Berg. \n\nNo. \tTitle \t\t                Length\n1. \t&quot;GlasÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤pplen&quot; \t                4:48\n2. \t&quot;Ismael&quot;   \t \t        4:25\n3. \t&quot;Skisser fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶r sommaren&quot; \t        4:15\n4. \t&quot;ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾rlighet Respekt KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤rlek&quot; \t4:28\n5. \t&quot;Varje gÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ng du mÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ter min blick&quot; 4:27\n6. \t&quot;Ensam lÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ng vÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤g hem&quot;            4:11\n7. \t&quot;Team building&quot;   \t \t3:58\n8. \t&quot;Gamla Ullevi&quot;  \t\t3:39\n9. \t&quot;Minimalen&quot; \t                4:21\n10. \t&quot;Passagerare&quot; \t                4:18\n\nTotal Length: 37:32\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n100% Virus Free | Scanned with: avast!
