As she strolls along singing &quot;I'm On My Way to Grampy's&quot;, she is joined by two moving men, a fireman and a traffic cop - all who irresponsibly drop everything (including a piano, a burning house and a traffic jam) to go to Grampy's party.\n\nGrampy is an eccentric inventor, whose labor-saving devices are of the Rube Goldberg variety. For example, he has a device that moves his entire house to the front entrance whenever the doorbell is rung. The glass shade of his ceiling light is rigged to double as a punch bowl and he has modified an old umbrella to slice a cake into wedges.\n\nGrampy entertains his guests by building self-playing musical instruments out of household gadgets (which then play &quot;Hold That Tiger&quot;). Everyone dances until they drop from exhaustion, the exception being the exuberant Grampy.\n\nProducer: Max Fleischer\nAudio/Visual: sound, b/w","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e026bdb62104194cc5ccd387dd390c79ea47ea5","amp;dn":"Betty+Boop+and+Grampy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e026bdb62104194cc5ccd387dd390c79ea47ea5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,2,107,219,98,16,65,148,204,92,205,56,125,211,144,199,158,164,126,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
