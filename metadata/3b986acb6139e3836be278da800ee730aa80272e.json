After the Nazis stormed into Poland, Stalin ordered Russian soldiers into the country as well, in order to oversee the imprisonment of all Polish officers. As these prisoners fearfully struggled to make sense of what was happening to them, the women in their lives--wives, siblings, mothers, daughters--anxiously awaited their return. Though mystery shrouded the events that were to unfold, these women eventually learned the bitter truth. Sadly, they were ordered to remain silent due to post-war Polands dependence on Russia.\n\nThough he won an honorary Oscar in 2000, Wajda proves with KATYN that he has no intention of slowing down. Based on a novel by Andrzej Mularczyck (POST MORTEM), Wajda elevates it into a work of pure cinema. It helps that hes chosen some truly accomplished collaborators: Pawel Edelmans richly textured cinematography and Krzysztof Pendereckis powerful, resonant score help to further establish an atmosphere of beautiful sorrow. The cast--including Maja Osteszewska, Artur Zmijewski, and Andrzej Chyra--rise to the challenge as well, bringing a humanity and warmth to their characters that pack an even more devastating emotional punch.\n\nArtur Zmijewski, Maja Ostaszewska, Andrzej Chyra, Danuta Stenka, Jan Englert\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                          &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/OmifastGR&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/OmifastGR&lt;/a&gt;\n\n!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b986acb6139e3836be278da800ee730aa80272e","amp;dn":"Katyn+%5B2007%5DDvDrip+DivX7%5BPol%5D%5BSUBs+Eng%2BGreek%5D+Omifast","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b986acb6139e3836be278da800ee730aa80272e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,152,106,203,97,57,227,131,107,226,120,218,128,14,231,48,170,128,39,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
