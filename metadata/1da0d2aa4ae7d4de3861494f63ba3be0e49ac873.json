Smith responded to the devastation in Haiti the best way he knew how: by writing a song he hopes will motivate listeners to offer a hand ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ or a dollar.\n\nSmith, with Cindy Morgan and David Mullen, wrote ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCome Together NowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ on January 15, spurred by the 7.0 earthquake that ravaged the island nation on January 12. Proceeds from the sale of the song are to be donated to Haiti relief efforts. (The song will be made available digitally, but details for sale and distribution have yet to be finalized.)\n\nBy Wednesday night, the plan had grown to include more than 100 Christian and country artists. The Oak Ridge Boys, Point of Grace, Casting Crowns, Steven Curtis Chapman, Lee Greenwood, Brandon Heath, TobyMac, Wynonna, Matt Maher and a host of others poured into BelmontÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Ocean Way Studios to sing with Smith.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re just trying to do our part to come to the aid of this poor nation that so desperately needs our help,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Smith said. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œObviously, it all started with a song, and I thought it might be a draw if we all sang it together. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just miraculous itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all come together in 11 days.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nMichael W.
