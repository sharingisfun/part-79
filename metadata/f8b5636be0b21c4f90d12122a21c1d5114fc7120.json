It will require tactical planning and a liberal amount of brute force to escape to safety. Each of the eight squad members possesses distinctive skills and weaponry that the player will have to use wisely to progress through the gameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s story driven objectives. Raven Squad sets itself apart by allowing players to switch freely between real-time strategy and first-person shooter gameplay. Only by mastering both of these modes of play, and becoming adept at switching between the two, will players make it out of the jungle alive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8b5636be0b21c4f90d12122a21c1d5114fc7120","amp;dn":"Raven+Squad+Operation+Hidden+Dagger+%5BMULTI3%5D%5BRF%5Dgamerguuy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8b5636be0b21c4f90d12122a21c1d5114fc7120","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,181,99,107,224,178,28,79,144,209,33,34,162,28,29,81,20,252,113,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
