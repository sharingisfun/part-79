Scattered across the terrain, they find one-hundred tonne granite boulders, giant potholes, 40-foot ripples carved into the landscape and scratch marks gouged into the bedrock. &quot;In geology we are really looking for evidence of features in the rocks, on the landscape. It is very similar to what a detective does looking for clues at a crime scene. Those clues fit into a pattern and ultimately a culprit is associated with that crime scene,&quot; explains Geosciences Professor Vic Baker, from the University of Arizona.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c050a63ab56a914b325e74e246ee098e77c87d71","amp;dn":"Nat+Geo+Wild+-+Earth+Shocks+-+Megaflood+TVRIP.XDROP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c050a63ab56a914b325e74e246ee098e77c87d71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,80,166,58,181,106,145,75,50,94,116,226,70,238,9,142,119,200,125,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
