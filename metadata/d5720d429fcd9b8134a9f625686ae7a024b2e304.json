As host of the nationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s premiere sports radio talk show, Rome is known for his aggressive, informed, rapid-fire dialogue. Jim has established himself as the top choice of athletes and fans when it is time to know what is going on beyond the scoreboard.\n\nRomeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nationally syndicated radio program, The Jim Rome Show, a.k.a. The Jungle, airs on more than 200 radio stations each weekday and boasts more than two million listeners. But these are no ordinary listeners; they are a legion of fans known as the clones who live and breathe for Jim RomeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtakeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ on the dayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s larger issues of sport. It is his departure from conventional sports commentary that has resulted in RomeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unique dialogue with his listeners.\n\nIn addition to his daily radio grind, Rome returned to ESPN to host Jim Rome Is Burning, a daily, provocative sports talk show airing at 4:30p.m. EST. The program originates from Los Angeles and features opinion, RomeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œrants,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ debate and guest appearances by some of the biggest name in sports.\n\nRome has made a cameo appearances along side Al Pacino and Matthew McConaughey in Two For The Money, with Adam Sandler in The Longest Yard and opposite Michael Jordan in Space Jam; appeared in Blink 182ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music video; appeared on HBOÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œArliss;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and released a CD, Welcome to the Jungle, which features memorable sound bites from frequent callers and the hip music regularly used on the radio show.\n\nRome previously served as host of the popular program The Last Word with Jim Rome, broadcast nightly on Fox Sports Net, for five years. Prior to The Last Word with Jim Rome, Jim spent a two-year stint hosting ESPN2ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Talk2, a nightly one-hour interview show. Rome began his radio career at KTMS, Santa Barbara as the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ$5 dollar-an-hourÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ traffic reporter and covered UC Santa BarbaraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sports. He left KTMS for San DiegoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all-sports station, XTRA Sports 690. It was during a temporary stint on a late-night show for the station that Rome debuted his ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsmackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (Jungle Glossary term meaning sports talk in a gloating, uninhibited or unbridled manner). The style yielded high ratings, and, by acclimation of his listeners, The Jungle was born. In 1996, to further keep up with demand, Premiere Radio Networks acquired exclusive syndication rights and the program continues to pick-up affiliates throughout the country.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5720d429fcd9b8134a9f625686ae7a024b2e304","amp;dn":"The+Jim+Rome+Show+8-27-9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5720d429fcd9b8134a9f625686ae7a024b2e304","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,114,13,66,159,205,155,129,52,169,246,37,104,106,231,160,36,178,227,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
