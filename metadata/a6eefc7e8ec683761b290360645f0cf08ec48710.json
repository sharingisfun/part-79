It was at Bard College where Johanna met guitarist/experimental noise collaborator Jonathan Nocera and together these two musicians have come up with an impressive compilation of songs that will soon serve as a debut release. The upcoming album is set to be titled It is Like a Horse/It is Not Like Two Foxes and we have another gem that will eventually belong to this dreamy little offering.\n\n\n\nSongs:\n\nBedding Wells\n\nI Must Mend the Sail\n\nNot the Only One","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6eefc7e8ec683761b290360645f0cf08ec48710","amp;dn":"sTickLipS+-+3+songs+%5Bshad0w325%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6eefc7e8ec683761b290360645f0cf08ec48710","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,238,252,126,142,198,131,118,27,41,3,96,100,95,12,240,142,196,135,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
