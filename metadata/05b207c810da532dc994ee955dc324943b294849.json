I used to improvise a lot and made sure a song never sounded the same twice&quot; says Steve.\n\nSteve's talents were quickly spotted by manager John Black. &quot;I watched Steve develop himself to the point I knew we were ready to approach labels&quot;, says John. There was immediate interest from several, but RCA were always the first choice.\n\nSteve was also quickly snapped up by music publishing giant EMI. This debut album was entirely written, recorded and produced by Steve in his re-built home studio. &quot;I'm lucky RCA trusted me to do it all myself&quot; Says Steve.\n\nSteveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s influences come from all genres. &quot;I like Bob Marley to Shy FX, Stevie Ray Vaughan to Nas and most things in-between, I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t discriminateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says Steve.\n\nSteve has recently taken his unique sound onto the live circuit, where he is winning audiences from across the country.\n\nOne listen to Steve Appleton would dispel any notion that he is 'just another singer-songwriter'. There is no one else who makes pop music quite like his. Check him out.\n\n Track List:\n01. Rule The World\n02. The Bright Side\n03. Seeing Stars\n04. Wake Up Honey\n05. Dirty Funk\n06.
