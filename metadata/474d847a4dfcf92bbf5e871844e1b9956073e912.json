No one on earth can make you laugh as heartily or touch your heart as deeply...the whole world laughs, cries and thrills to his priceless genius!\n\nLaugh . . . Cry and Thrill To his Genius . . !\n\nYou'll never laugh as long and as loud again as long as you live! The laughs come so fast and so furious you'll wish it would end before you collapse!\n\nChaplin's last 'silent' film, filled with sound effects, was made when everyone else was making talkies. Charlie turns against modern society, the machine age, (The use of sound in films ?) and progress. Firstly we see him frantically trying to keep up with a production line, tightening bolts. He is selected for an experiment with an automatic feeding machine, but various mishaps leads his boss to believe he has gone mad, and Charlie is sent to a mental hospital... When he gets out, he is mistaken for a communist while waving a red flag, sent to jail, foils a jailbreak, and is let out again. We follow Charlie through many more escapades before the film is out.

In the film, Charlie becomes literally trapped in the machine and, in one of his finest patches of comic invention, is battered and buffeted by an automatic feeding machine introduced by his bosses to save time and money. Cured after his breakdown, he is arrested when he picks up a red flag that has fallen off the back of a lorry, and runs down the street to return it, exactly the same time as a left-wing demonstration comes round the corner. He meets 'The Gamine' (Paulette Goddard) in the back of the police van, who has also been arrested for stealing bread. From then on the theme is about two nondescripts trying to get along in modern times. &quot;Smile, though your heart is breaking ...&quot; Written by alfiehitchie \n\n\nFile Confirmation:\nComplete name                    : C:Documents and SettingsOwnerDesktopconvMODERN_ TIMES_DVDrip_big_dad_e.mp4\nFormat                           : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                   : Base Media\nCodec ID                         : isom\nFile size                        : 924 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 23mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 553 Kbps\nMovie name                       : MODERN_ TIMES_DVDrip_big_dad_e\nEncoded date                     : UTC 2009-08-02 18:31:58\nTagged date                      : UTC 2009-08-02 18:31:58\nComment                          : QuickTime 6.0 or greater\n\nVideo\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : 20\nDuration                         : 1h 23mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 1 436 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                 : 768 Kbps\nWidth                            : 320 pixels\nHeight                           : 240 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4:3\nFrame rate mode                  : Constant\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.624\nStream size                      : 854 MiB (92%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.1.0 (UTC 2005-11-22)\nEncoded date                     : UTC 2009-08-02 18:31:58\nTagged date                      : UTC 2009-08-02 18:31:58\n\nAudio\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AAC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat version                   : Version 4\nFormat profile                   : LC\nFormat settings, SBR             : No\nCodec ID                         : 40\nDuration                         : 1h 23mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 112 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nResolution                       : 16 bits\nStream size                      : 66.6 MiB (7%)\nEncoded date                     : UTC 2009-08-02 18:31:58\nTagged date                      : UTC 2009-08-02 18:31:58\n\nFile Scan:\nMalwarebytes' Anti-Malware 1.39\nDatabase version: 2546\nWindows 5.1.2600 Service Pack 3\n\n8/2/2009 11:06:31 PM\nmbam-log-2009-08-02 (23-06-31).txt\n\nScan type: Quick Scan\nObjects scanned: 1\nTime elapsed: 35 second(s)\n\nMemory Processes Infected: 0\nMemory Modules Infected: 0\nRegistry Keys Infected: 0\nRegistry Values Infected: 0\nRegistry Data Items Infected: 0\nFolders Infected: 0\nFiles Infected: 0\n\nMemory Processes Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nMemory Modules Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Keys Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Values Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Data Items Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFolders Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFiles Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\n        When using TPB please read these important notes: \n    \n\n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of \n    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust\n    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. \n    \n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause\n    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow \n    apps &amp; MALWARE!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period\n    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull &amp; Crossbones icon are trusted.\n\n06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously\n    comment or have any torrents, or just a few to look passable.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and\n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.\n\n10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result\n    in getting banned from TPB!\n \n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor more of my torrents:\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/big_dad_e/  (Secured)\n\nAll torrents scanned with:\nNorton Anti-virus\nMalwarebytes' Anti-malware\n\nALWAYS SEED!\n\n\nQuicktime for iPod\n\nAnother example of why the war on drugs = FAIL!  Charlie does cocaine in this movie while in the slammer.  J. Edgar Hoover had him &quot;listed&quot; as a result of this film.  R.I.P.
