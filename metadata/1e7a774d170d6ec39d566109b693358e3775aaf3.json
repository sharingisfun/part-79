This includes 1582 .torrent files (NOT the actual files in the torrents). How did I download all of these without throwing my life away downloading each one individually? &gt;&gt;DownThemAll&lt;&lt;\n\nDownThemAll is an extension for Mozilla Firefox That speeds up downloads,  but it also has a feature called dTa OneClick that will download all the files with the extentions you check off, I added a filter for .torrent files and checked only .torrent files to download, then all I had to do is go page by page, right clicking and clicking &quot;dTa OneClick&quot; and it downloaded all the .torrent files on the page in one click.\n\nMalestrom is awesome, he uploads lots of ebooks as well as occasionally other kinds of files. His official name on The Pirate Bay is Malestrom_HH.\n\nKnock yourself out!\n\n\n\nSide Note: Sorry about the .RAR format, it's not possible to upload a torrent that lists that many files on The Pirate Bay, so I had to RAR it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e7a774d170d6ec39d566109b693358e3775aaf3","amp;dn":"All+Malestrom+Torrents+to+Oct+25th+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e7a774d170d6ec39d566109b693358e3775aaf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,122,119,77,23,13,110,195,157,86,97,9,182,147,53,142,55,117,170,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
