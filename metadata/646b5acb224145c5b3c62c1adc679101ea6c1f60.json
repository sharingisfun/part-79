He's about 30, solitary, quiet, and big. He watches TV, likes heavy metal, and sometimes works as a bouncer at a disco. One night he notices one of the cleaning crew, Julia; he watches her via the cameras as she works, then follows some days as she goes to an Internet cafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, the beach, shopping, or the movies. He stays out of her sight and never talks to her. Thinking she may be hiding somewhere in the store with a male co-worker, Jarita breaks some rules and gets suspended. Then, while watching her one evening, she meets a man. What will Jara do?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:646b5acb224145c5b3c62c1adc679101ea6c1f60","amp;dn":"Gigante.2009.NTSC.DVDR-mEsSiAh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"646b5acb224145c5b3c62c1adc679101ea6c1f60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,107,90,203,34,65,69,197,179,198,44,26,220,103,145,1,234,108,31,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
