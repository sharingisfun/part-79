The game's 12 levels are all set in North Africa during World War II. It's a good looking, fun, but forgotten game today.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦score on -gamespot- 7.3 (good)!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a199e198f14886923f5ba75a46903560f963f1a3","amp;dn":"WWII+Desert+Rats+%28PC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a199e198f14886923f5ba75a46903560f963f1a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,153,225,152,241,72,134,146,63,91,167,90,70,144,53,96,249,99,241,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
