Ok, so it's a little more complicated than that. Maggie is the first wife of casino mogul Freddy Gold, who left her with nothing after a messy divorce. To add insult to injury, after Freddy shows up dead it's revealed that he's leaving the casino to his second wife, once again leaving Maggie (and her children) in the lurch. The time is right for payback, and Maggie has one night to find a way into the casino and pull off her big heist before it's too late.\n\n\n\n\nInstall notes:\njust install and play.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d135312c4f472f1775a8904909d2af5fdb1bb3b","amp;dn":"Slingo+Mystery+HOG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d135312c4f472f1775a8904909d2af5fdb1bb3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,19,83,18,196,244,114,241,119,90,137,4,144,157,42,245,253,177,187,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
