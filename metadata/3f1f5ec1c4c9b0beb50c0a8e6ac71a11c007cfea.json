Make a proper backup using the Windows Explorer - not Tomtom Home!!\n1.1 Make sure you see all files and folders -even hidden and system!! (check under settings)\n1.2 Check if you backups is really complete - if not you might be in trouble if you need to restore your old system\n\n2. If you have a slot for a memory card - USE IT!!!\nWhy? Because you always keep a working system on your internal memory and a 2GB SD card is less than $10! A new Tomtom is ??\n\n3. Check if there are special instructions in regards to the Navcore you download e.g. settings for a SE Navcore ,if the Navcore is complete or if you need to download voices and so on...\n\n4. Download all files you need ,like Nacore ,map ,voices , keygens ,POI's into a folder on you har disc - make sure you make &quot;intelligent subfolders&quot; like &quot;Navcore&quot; , &quot;MAP&quot; ,&quot;REST&quot; in order to not confuse yourself!\n\n5. Check the 1. before you continue \n\n6. If you have a SD card delete everything what is on there. \nIf you use your internal memory do the same ,but leave it connected and don't turn it off!\n6.1 Hint : if you have a card reader - use it because it will be much faster than using the card in your Tomtom!\n\n7. Copy all files and folder for the Navcore to the root of your &quot;system&quot; (System means the SD card if you use it ,or the internal memory if don't use a card!)\n\n8. Copy all files for your new map into a folder on your &quot;system&quot; e.g. &quot;Australia&quot; ,but make sure you are not using a subfolder within it - sometime a map in a downloaded archive is already in a folder e.g.Australia_830_2352. So either copy that folder to root of your system or the files within into the folder you created for the map.\n\n9. Start your Tomtom once to create a new &quot;ttgo.bif&quot; - turn it off without accessing the menu and ignore warnings that you can't use the map or that no map is found!\n\n10. Use a keygen to activate the map and if you use an original Navcore to patch the &quot;ttsystem&quot;\n\n11. Start your Tomtom to configure the setting and enjoy!\n\nIf these steps are not working for you : DON'T PANIC!!!\nMost likely you have made a minor mistake on the way - start over and try again after a short break.\nError mesages related to the map occur mostly because of a non patched &quot;ttsystem&quot; or not properly activated map - so check the keygen part again!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f1f5ec1c4c9b0beb50c0a8e6ac71a11c007cfea","amp;dn":"Tom+tom+Turkije+and+North+America+835+2419","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f1f5ec1c4c9b0beb50c0a8e6ac71a11c007cfea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,31,94,193,196,201,176,190,181,12,10,142,106,199,26,17,192,7,207,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
