She moved with her family to the United States at age 4. She began playing the guitar at age 11. Her vocal range is mezzo-soprano.\n\nIn 1975 at the age of 17 she joined the all-female rock band The Runaways, for whom she played lead guitar.\n\nAfter the group split in 1979, she began a solo career. Her first album, Out for Blood including the title single was released in 1983 and had no luck on the charts. The next effort, Dancin' on the Edge of 1984 got a moderate success. It included the single &quot;Fire In My Heart&quot; which reached the Top 10 in several countries. The next single &quot;Gotta Let Go&quot; was one of Ford's biggest hits. It reached Number One on the Mainstream Rock charts.\n\nFord toured extensively and made several guest appearances on TV shows for the next four years, but had no releases; a follow-up to Dancin' On The Edge, titled The Bride Wore Black, was abandoned and never released due to the fact Ford did not like the production of the album and this upset the head of her record label causing Ford to switch from Mercury Records to RCA Records. By the time Ford returned again, the lighter pop-metal she had long favored had broken through to mainstream audiences, which set the stage for her most commercially successful album, 1988's Lita. With Sharon Osbourne as her manager, and again produced by herself, the album featured four commercial hits, including &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot;, &quot;Back To The Cave&quot;, &quot;Close My Eyes Forever&quot;, and &quot;Falling In And Out Of Love&quot; (co-written with Nikki Sixx of MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e). The ballad &quot;Close My Eyes Forever&quot;, a duet with Ozzy Osbourne, was her only Top 10 Billboard Hot 100 hit, reaching #8.\n\nDancin' on the Edge is Lita Ford's second solo album. It features the drummer Randy Castillo, who later played for Ozzy Osbourne. It also features the bassist Hugh McDonald, who is currently the hired studio/live session bassist for Bon Jovi.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2d765e1b8564a6b735bbad939a2a376f9094421","amp;dn":"Lita+Ford+-+Dressed+To+Kill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2d765e1b8564a6b735bbad939a2a376f9094421","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,215,101,225,184,86,74,107,115,91,186,217,57,162,163,118,249,9,68,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
