It was released by EMI Records on May 14, 2001. \nScream if You Wanna Go Faster was released as a single and is a cover version of the Weather Girls &quot;It's Raining Men&quot; (1983), which became Halliwell's fourth and (to date) final no.1 UK.\nAlthough not as successful as her debut album Schizophonic, it reached a peak position of number five on the UK album chart. With first-week sales of 35,000 copies and total sales of 155,000, it became the 127th best selling album of 2001 in the UK.
