Shot on a shoestring budget on a beach and in an old cloister, the style of this scathing surrealist satire is immediately recognizable as that of the Feuillade serials. In top hat and tails, the Master of Crime (played by the future father of French singer Johnny Hallyday) tours the world in pursuit of the beautiful Elvire, punctuating his travels with mischief and acts to offend proper decency. The film encompasses amour fou, the meanders of dreams, fanatical anti-clericalism and a plea for subversion and adventure in &quot;a world where nothing is impossible, where the miracle is the shortest route from our uncertainty to mystery&quot; (E. Moerman).\n\nAt the end of the nineteen twenties, two future film-makers discover their medium. Charles Dekeukeleire and Henri Storck will become famous documentary film-makers, but their debuts consist of experiments and the search of a 'pure cinema'. With the occasional surrealists Henri d'Ursel and Ernst Moerman, they make up the first avant-garde generation in Belgian cinema.\n\nSeven composers wrote the music for these unique films: Joachim Brackx, Eric Sleichim, Jan Van Outryve, Annelies Van Parys (in residence at Transparant) and Mireille Capelle, Geert Callaert and Thomas Smetryns (in residence at HERMESensemble). The works for ensemble are performed by the HERMES ensemble conducted by Koen Kessels.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfd60798f49b28fbe7d8a3fc625e76020a5a14cc","amp;dn":"moerman+-+monsieur+fantomas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfd60798f49b28fbe7d8a3fc625e76020a5a14cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,214,7,152,244,155,40,251,231,216,163,252,98,94,118,2,10,90,20,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
