Peep Stupid Stupid, the group's blissed-out four-song EP and you'll find yourself in the presence of irresistible, garage-bred rockers like &quot;Death by Mixtape&quot; and &quot;Pop Song.&quot; The former is an edgy, confectionary rocker and the closest thing to an anthem, but the latter is equally a winner with a strong melody and frontman Ben Lashes' energetic look at the power pop genre.&quot; All it's gonna take is just another pop song/to make everything okay,&quot; Lashes soundly proclaims. And the Lashes -- complete with a wicked roll of guitars and keyboards -- are true believers, be it the sturdy, lovelorn &quot;Ex-Mas (Young in Love)&quot; or the scenester-chick homage &quot;It's Your Party.&quot; Fun as hell, and superbly crafted, Stupid Stupid easily leaves listeners clamoring for more -- making word that there's a full-length in the band's future superb news for those in need of additional manic pop thrills.\n\n01.
