For once, the future looks fairly bright. But the past casts one hell of a long shadow.\n\nAn old bargain has placed Harry in debt to Mab, monarch of the Winter Court of the Sidhe, the Queen of Air and Darkness - and she's calling in her marker. It's a small favor he can't refuse, one that will trap Harry Dresden between a nightmarish foe and an equally deadly ally, and one that will strain his skills-and loyalties-to their very limits.\n\nIt figures. Everything was going too well to last....\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â©2008 Jim Butcher; (P)2008 Penguin","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62ce67402fe9e16cbea814474a565e3bb6624e0b","amp;dn":"Dresden+Files+Book+10+-+Small+Favor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62ce67402fe9e16cbea814474a565e3bb6624e0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,206,103,64,47,233,225,108,190,168,20,71,74,86,94,59,182,98,78,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
