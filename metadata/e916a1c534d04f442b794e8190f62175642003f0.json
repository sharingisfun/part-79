(User Account Control)\nThe Application allows each user to maintain individual settings while at the same time seamlessly integrating any administrative commands directly into the users account. New users accounts are detected upon opening the Application and automatically inherit the Administrators settings.\n\n\nCodecs have been a problem for most users at one time or another.\nThis is because there has never been an 'out of the box' working solution that the average computer user could install and just have everything work properly from the beginning. There are several decent codec package solutions out there, but none of them did everything I wanted. I was always in need of a tweak, adjustment, or even a re-installation just to get the codecs I needed/wanted and most of the time, the file still didn't play properly.\nI've never claimed to be a media guru. My media experience prior to creating these packages was to double-click a file I downloaded and hope that it played. \n\n\nThe installer will automatically remove most other popular codec releases from your computer before installing this concise yet comprehensive package.\nYou won't need to make any adjustments or tweaks to enjoy your media content immediately. Windows Media Player and Vista's Media Center will instantly recognize all your files as playable.\n\n\nIt does not contain a media player and it does not associate file-types.\nWith this package installed you will be able to use any media player, limited only by the players' capabilities, to play all movies and video clips.\nStreaming video is supported in several formats in all popular web browsers.\nUsers of VCP have the ability to choose what is installed and where to install it using the public redistributable. After installation you can select to remove specific portions without removing the entire package.\nYou can also re-add the removed items at any time.\n\n\nThis package supports 20 localizations.\nThe default is English and the installer includes support for the following other languages; Arabic, Chinese Simplified/Traditional, Japanese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Polish, Swedish and Turkish. Languages can be added upon request. \n\n\nUninstall ALL codec related installations\nbefore installing this comprehensive package.\n\nUNINSTALL YOUR OLD VERSION  - upgrades are enabled but not recommended\n\n\nIF you have RealPlayer installed choose a CUSTOM\ninstallation and deselect [X] that item from the menu.\n\n\nChangelog:\n\n\nUpdate FFDShow to rev 3036\n\nUpdate Gabests splitters to rev 1179\n\nUse Monogram filters for Musepack support\n\nAdd MediaInfo interface to the Settings Application\n\nAllow the file renderer to open All Files\n\nFix a bug that was breaking Audio in some games\n\nDisable installation onto unsupported systems\n\n\n\nComments from the uploader (olofolleola4):\nHere is a list of all things automatically uninstalled by the VCP installer:\n\nAC3Filter Spdifer\nAC3Filter\nHaali MatroskaSplitter\nReal Alternative\nK-Lite Codec Pack - all versions\nCombined Community Codec Pack\nffdshow standalone installer\nXviD standalone installer\nStorm Codec Pack\nXP Codec Pack\nSatsuki Decoder Pack\nTheorica Divx ;-) Codecs\nLD-Anim\nACE Mega CoDecS Pack\nMUSK Codec Pack v5\nTTPack\nRecode Media\nCodec Pack - All In 1\nCole 2k codecpack\nCodecPack\nEssentials Codec Pack\nXiph.Org Ogg Codecs\n\nIf you DO NOT want something on this list uninstalled,\nchoose a CUSTOM installation and de-select Conflict detection.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e916a1c534d04f442b794e8190f62175642003f0","amp;dn":"Vista+Codec+Package+5.3.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e916a1c534d04f442b794e8190f62175642003f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,22,161,197,52,208,79,68,43,121,78,129,144,246,33,117,100,32,3,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
