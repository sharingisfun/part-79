Thank you!\n\n\nThe Animals were an English music group of the 1960s known in the United States as part of the British Invasion. The group formed in Newcastle upon Tyne during the early part of the decade, then relocated to London. Known for their gritty, bluesy sound and deep-voiced frontman Eric Burdon ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ as exemplified by their number one signature song &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot; as well as by hits such as &quot;We Gotta Get Out of This Place&quot; and &quot;It's My Life&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the band balanced tough, rock-edged pop singles against rhythm and blues-oriented album material. The prominent keyboard work of Alan Price gave the band another distinctive aspect to their sound. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Animals&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Animals&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nReview by Stephen Thomas Erlewine (AMG)\nReleased by the Holland-based company Disky, the single-disc collection Original Hits contains all of the Animals' biggest hits and best cuts from their British Invasion peak ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ meaning everything before the group fractured and Eric Burdon started up the New Animals. This collection may not offer much in the way of liner notes (just John Tobler's good testimonial) and the sound isn't spectacular (not bad by any means, but it hasn't been remastered), but this does offer more than ABKCO's domestic collection and it's easier to digest than EMI's double-disc set The Compleat Animals, so it very well might be\nthe compilation of choice for many listeners. \n\n\nThe Animals - Original Hits\nDisky Records 1995, mono\n\n01  The Animals - Original Hits - The House Of The Rising Sun  \n02  The Animals - Original Hits - We've Gotta Get Out Of This Place  \n03  The Animals - Original Hits - Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood  \n04  The Animals - Original Hits - Bring It On Home To Me  \n05  The Animals - Original Hits - Boom Boom  \n06  The Animals - Original Hits - Memphis Tennessee  \n07  The Animals - Original Hits - Baby Let Me Take You Home  \n08  The Animals - Original Hits - Club-A-Gogo  \n09  The Animals - Original Hits - I'm Mad Again  \n10  The Animals - Original Hits - It's My Life  \n11  The Animals - Original Hits - Bright Lights Big City  \n12  The Animals - Original Hits - The Story Of Bo Diddley  \n13  The Animals - Original Hits - She Said Yeah  \n14  The Animals - Original Hits - Around And Around  \n15  The Animals - Original Hits - The Girl Can't Help It  \n16  The Animals - Original Hits - I've Been Around  \n17  The Animals - Original Hits - How You've Changed  \n18  The Animals - Original Hits - I'm Crying\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:wpfwxqu0ld6e&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:wpfwxqu0ld6e&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57e516d1f0355e97fcd76686655f4d7c945e2fa3","amp;dn":"Animals+-+Original+Hits+%5Bnew%5D++FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57e516d1f0355e97fcd76686655f4d7c945e2fa3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,229,22,209,240,53,94,151,252,215,102,134,101,95,77,124,148,94,47,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
