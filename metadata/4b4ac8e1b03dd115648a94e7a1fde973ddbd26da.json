Since then, Madeleine, who was then nearly four, has become the best-known ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“missing childÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ in the world. The McCanns claimed she was abducted, by an abductor who has never been traced. They said they were wining and dining in a Tapas bar 100 yards away from where they had left their three young children in their holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, on the beautiful Algarve coast. \n  \nThe Portuguese police believed the McCanns were involved in the disappearance of Madeleine. They were made official suspects on 7 September 2007 - and remained so until July 2008. Then, the Portuguese Attorney-General announced that there was insufficient evidence for any person to be charged in connection with MadeleineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“disappearanceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, though he added that there was evidence that Madeleine was dead. The McCannsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ spokesman, Clarence Mitchell, who used to head the governmentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 40-strong Media Monitoring Unit, whose function Mr Mitchell said was ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“to control what comes out in the mediaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, claimed that the McCanns had been ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“clearedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.     \n\nIn October 2007, the senior detective in charge, Goncalo Amaral, was replaced, claiming British government interference in his investigation. A few years earlier, he solved another ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“missing childÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ case - that of 8-year-old Joana Cipriano. Her mother and uncle were convicted for her murder, having initially claimed she was abducted. Goncalo Amaral has since written a book, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The Truth About A LieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, showing that Madeleine died in Praia da Luz. A documentary he made about MadeleineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death can be seen onhere:     \n \nThis leaflet gives 10 key reasons which suggest Madeleine was not abducted. It is a shortened version of a 64-page booklet published in Britain in December 2008, titled: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhat Really Happened to Madeleine McCann? - 60 Reasons which suggest she was not abductedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.
