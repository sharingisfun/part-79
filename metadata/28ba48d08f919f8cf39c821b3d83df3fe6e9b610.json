The variety of products and people keep the program as juicy and tender as an August peach in North Carolina.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 56mn 30s 24ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 027 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 352 (1.727) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 110 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28ba48d08f919f8cf39c821b3d83df3fe6e9b610","amp;dn":"PBS+-+To+Market+To+Market+To+Buy+A+Fat+Pig.%282007%29.WS-PDTV.XviD%7EE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28ba48d08f919f8cf39c821b3d83df3fe6e9b610","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,186,72,208,143,145,159,140,243,156,130,27,61,131,223,63,230,233,182,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
