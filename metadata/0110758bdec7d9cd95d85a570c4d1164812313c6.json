Flex Blur speaking.\n\nWell, I planned to do a mix and release a new album, both of them Japan-styled, but as far as I don't work on the album, last days I was working on my MIDI/USB controllers' configuration so I can mix using them, inside Traktor Pro. So, as I didn't have an Internet connection, I spent my whole last Monday and Tuesday to select effects, clicking on &quot;Learn&quot; and pressing buttons, turning the knobs and moving the sliders, then putting some stickers where I wrote things on, so I can know what this button does, and this knob, oh and these two sliders, blah blah. I did some tests, and it gave an EP absolutely not serious. It has 5 tracks and is called traktorwork, where I play with japanese songs : capsule, Shinichi Osawa and Aira Mitsuki are my main ideas bringers. This EP is most likely a trailer of my mix to come. There we are, I hope that you will like it !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0110758bdec7d9cd95d85a570c4d1164812313c6","amp;dn":"Flex+Blur+-+traktorwork","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0110758bdec7d9cd95d85a570c4d1164812313c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,16,117,139,222,199,217,205,149,216,90,87,12,77,17,100,129,35,19,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
