Soon they are joined by many others, all running from the savagery being inflicted on the Jews. The eldest of the Bielski brother, Tuvia and Zus, disagree over what to do with the growing forest population. Tuvye believes that they must welcome anyone who wants to join them while Zus thinks they should be fighting the Germans. After a major falling out, Zus joins the local Russian partisans - with whom the Bielskis had already completed an informal truce - and Tuvia continues stays with their forest community.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst, though the text at the beginning says &quot;A True Story&quot;, it is not ENTIRELY true.  Although more accurate than MOST films which start with &quot;Based on a True Story&quot;, this film does have some small historical inaccuracies.  But don't let that detract from your enjoyment of the film or the amazing story it details ... the Bielski brothers were heroes and their story is worth seeing at least once.  Personally, when I heard that they were adapting Nechama Tec's &quot;Defiance: The Bielski Partisans&quot; into a major Hollywood film, I was afraid they'd screw it up horribly.\n\nThen I found out Edward Zwick was directing.  For those who don't keep track of directors, Edward Zwick is responsible for such films as Glory, Legends of the Fall, Courage Under Fire, The Last Samurai, The Siege, and Blood Diamond ... all great films which span multiple categories.  War, Romance, Action, Politics, Drama, History, etc.  He is a great director.  So I was able to breathe easy when I learned he was directing the film.  And when I saw it in the theater, I was highly impressed.\n\nThough there is a description above, for the history lover's ... here is a bit more of the story:\n\nIn 1939, a several small regions (Kresy, or &quot;Outlands&quot;/&quot;Outskirts&quot;) were annexed from Poland into the Soviet Union republics of Ukraine, Belarus, and Lithuania.  The area this film takes place in was annexed into Belarus.  This annexation was part of the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression pact of 1939.  For those who remember their WWII history, in 1939, the Nazi's and Soviets made a pact to not fight against each other, nor help each others' enemies in the current conflict in Europe.  Some historians believe this was probably the smartest move Hitler and the Nazi's made during WWII.\n\nHowever, what followed in 1941 is arguably the dumbest move Hitler and the Nazi's made ... they broke the deal and invaded the Soviet Union, starting a war on two fronts.  When the Nazi's invaded, these areas in Poland were the first to be recaptured.  When they were annexed, the Jews living in the areas were left unharmed, but by 1941, the laws of Germany were harsh towards Jews, prohibiting Jews from owning property, businesses, and having basic rights.  Jews in the cities were immediately moved into ghettos and thousands were slaughtered.  The German Army issued orders to kill Jews who tried to escape.\n\nThe Bielski brothers were such Jews.  They lived in the country outside a Belarusian town and their parents were one of the first families killed when they tried to flee into the woods.  The brothers escaped though and joined by several other Jews, they formed a Partisian, a &quot;rebel army&quot;, hiding out in the woods.  They built camps, made contact with Soviet Partisians, and raided the German and Polish people for supplies.\n\nWhat made the Bielski Partisian unique was that they had women and children under their protection.  A few of the Soviet Partisians had female soldiers in their ranks, but the Soviet Partisians were strictly military operations, they did not protect the citizens in the area.  This is ONE area where the film diverts from historical reports and records ... most of the Partisain groups were actually SUPPORTED by the Polish citizenry and there are very few reports or records of Partisian groups raiding the citizens for supplies.  Most Polish citizens were anti-German, but welcomed the Soviets, even in 1939 as it meant they would no longer be under German rule.  In fact, the Kresy (&quot;Borderlands&quot;), rejoined Ukraine, Belarus, and Lithuania when the war ended rather than rejoin Poland.\n\n\nHere are a few trivia tidbits I know about this film:\n1.  The mass grave scene which is seen at the beginning of the film uses real human bodies, though they were actually alive ... don't worry, the producers of the film didn't slaughter hundreds to make the film accurate.  Extras were brought in, asked to strip naked, then lie in the cold mud for quite some time while the filming took place.\n2.  Filming took place in a forest in Lithuania, less than one-hundred miles from the real location of the Bielski Partisian camp.\n3.  The German tank at the end of the film is one of the tanks previously used in &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot;.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdditional Info\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike all my iPod torrents, these files have their ID3 tags preformatted for your ease!
