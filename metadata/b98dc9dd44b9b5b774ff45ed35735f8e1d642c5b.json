We'll try to remedy this with this vinyl rip offering that for some mysterious reason never made it to CD. \n\nAlthough it does not say it anywhere on this LP (originally recorded in Japan for RCA), the &quot;challenge&quot; was that this was Hampton Hawes' first set of unaccompanied piano solos.  Although based in bop, Hawes was always much more than a one-handed pianist, and he proves up to the challenge.  The repertoire includes jazz standards, three originals, and the current pop tune &quot;Who Can I Turn To.&quot;  Throughout the date, the pianist shows that he could create stirring music without the assistance of a rhythm section. Unfortunately, this music (last put out on a Storyville LP) has yet to be reissued on CD. ~ Scott Yanow, All Music Guide\n\nHampton Hawes - The Challenge Tracks:\n01  Tokyo Blues\n02  Summertime\n03  What's New\n04  It Could Happen To You\n05  My Romance\n06  Autumn Leaves\n07  Just One Of Those Things\n08  Who Can I Turn To\n09  Bag's Groove\n10  Clementine\n11  Young People's Tune\n12  Shinjuku","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b98dc9dd44b9b5b774ff45ed35735f8e1d642c5b","amp;dn":"Hampton+Hawes+-+The+Challenge+%281968%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+541-651%5D%5Bschon55","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b98dc9dd44b9b5b774ff45ed35735f8e1d642c5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,141,201,221,68,185,181,183,116,255,69,237,53,115,95,142,29,100,44,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
