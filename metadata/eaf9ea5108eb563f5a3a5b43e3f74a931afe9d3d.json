The Living Edens\n\nThis could be a tourism promotion video for Palau, especially if you are a diver.\nAn excellent description and video of many types of corals - and footage that is hard to find: corals eating and reproducing (sexual and asexual). (With some music that makes you think of people hitting on each other in a Jazz bar!)\nThey show sponges and many other invertebrates. Some of the best footage is of the jellyfish, which has a mutualistic relationship with algae. As you watch you can only repeat: wow.\n\nThis is a very good illustration of a coral reef biome and mutulistic relationships (cleaner fish and sharks, jellyfish and algae, and others).\nIt is strongly narrated.\n\nThe Living Edens - Palau is one of the most exquisitely photographed documentaries to be made on the tropical Pacific ecosystem. Most of it is devoted to the underwater world of coral reefs, the climax being the mesmerizing account of the spawning of polyps on a full moon night. Also captured are countless fish, starfish, cuttlefish, sea cucumbers, sea anemones and a host of other creatures that make the reef their home. The other two highlights are the accounts of the distinctive jellyfish that have developed on an inland lake with their own daily rhythm based on the movements of the sun, and that of the &quot;cleaning area&quot; of the reef, where even the most feared predators forget their instincts to periodically come and get their dental and gill cleaning done by gentler creatures.\n\nAbout the only drawback is the far too brief (well, almost no) treatment of life above water, though there are some shots of the famed &quot;mushroom&quot; rocks and the only salt water crocs in the area.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone appreciating good photography and a must for all nature lovers.\nThis documentary briefly touches on all of the major aspects of underwater Palau. At times, it is a bit dreary with its emphasis on the lifecycle of nature. Nevertheless, the cinematography is fantastic. You can almost smell the ocean!\n\nÃƒï¿½Ã…Â¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Âº Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â²Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Â¹ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒâ€˜Ã…â€™ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Âº Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â´Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒï¿½Ã‚Âµ, Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Â¡Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€˜Ã…â€™ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â° Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¼Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â»Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Âµ?
