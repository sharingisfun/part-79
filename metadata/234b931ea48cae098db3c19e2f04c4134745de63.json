Case in point, KaganÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s friends are now being asked about her sexual orientation (if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re keeping score, they say sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not a lesbian).  See the White House-released video of Kagan below.\n\nMeanwhile, as expected, execs from BP, Transocean and Halliburton were questioned by two senate committees yesterday and did little more than blame each other for the uncontrollable gusher of oil in the Gulf.\n\nAlso, the Tea Party succeeds in taking over the Maine Republican platform, the grandkids of both Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter get into politics, Larry King calls off his eighth divorce, and Playboy goes 3-D.\n\nThese stories, your calls, and much more on todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Randi Rhodes Show.
