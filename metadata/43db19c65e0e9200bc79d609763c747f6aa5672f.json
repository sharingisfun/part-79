After collaborating on the song, &quot;Don't Box Me In&quot; with Stewart Copeland from The Police for the soundtrack to Francis Ford Coppola's Rumble Fish starring Mickey Rourke, Matt Dillon and Dennis Hopper he released his first proper solo album, The Big Heat (1986), which included the top 5 European (and UK) hit &quot;Camouflage&quot;. This was followed by numerous other solo recordings Mosquitos (1989), Partyball (1991), Black Diamond (1995), and Anatomy (1999), The Way I Feel Today (1998), a collection of big band standards (2000), and Holiday in Dirt (2001), a compilation of outtakes and previously unreleased songs. Ridgway's most recent solo outing is Snakebite: Blacktop Ballads and Fugitive Songs (2005), featuring the narrative song, &quot;Talkin' Wall Of Voodoo Blues Pt. 1&quot;, a history of his former band in song that was especially poignant, having followed the recent deaths of guitarist Marc Moreland and drummer Joe Nanini.\n\nIn the 1986 music video &quot;Drive She Said&quot;, Stan Ridgway drives a Metropolitan taxi cab.\n\nThe Big Heat is the 1986 debut solo album by former Wall of Voodoo vocalist Stan Ridgway, named after the 1953 noir film of the same name. Originally released as a nine-song album, including the #4 UK hit &quot;Camouflage&quot;, the album was re-released in 2004 with six additional tracks. In 1986, the album reached #131 on The Billboard 200.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43db19c65e0e9200bc79d609763c747f6aa5672f","amp;dn":"Stan+Ridgway+-+Drive+She+Said","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43db19c65e0e9200bc79d609763c747f6aa5672f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,219,25,198,94,14,146,0,188,121,214,9,118,60,116,127,106,165,103,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
