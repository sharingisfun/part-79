If after testing it you see that you like it and it's useful for you, show your support by buying it!\n\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf7a4854f0733531893e7856764afb5eb627fb22","amp;dn":"iPrint+6.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf7a4854f0733531893e7856764afb5eb627fb22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,122,72,84,240,115,53,49,137,62,120,86,118,74,251,94,182,39,251,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
