New Guinea is a rugged tropical island that is home to some of the\nstrangest creatures on the planet. The team is based at the foot of Mount Bosavi, a giant extinct volcano covered in thick and largely\nunexplored rainforest. With the help of trackers from a remote tribe, they aim to search for the animals that live there - and they make\namazing finds. Wildlife cameraman Gordon Buchanan discovers the nest of the world's smallest parrot, insect expert Dr George McGavin\nfinds a talking beetle, the scientists identify types of frog, gecko and bat that are completely new to science, and adventurer Steve\nBackshall has to live and sleep underground as he explores a cave system flooded with white water. The cameras follow the team\nevery sweaty step of the way as they search for the evidence that may help preserve this last great jungle forever.\n\nPart one &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5121468/BBC.Lost.Land.of.the.Volcano.1of3.HDTV&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5121468/BBC.Lost.Land.of.the.Volcano.1of3.HDTV&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\tGeorge McGavin\t ... \tHimself (3 episodes, 2009)\n\tSteve Backshall\t... \tHimself (3 episodes, 2009)\n\tGordon Buchanan\t... \tHimself (3 episodes, 2009)\n\tPhilip Glenister\t... \tHimself - Narrator (3 episodes, 2009)\n\tAlanna Maltby\t... \tHerself (2 episodes, 2009)\n\tMuse Opiang\t... \tHimself (2 episodes, 2009)\n\nPart three coming up","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb728b6fb47a7bee20fb6824cc6b13fa39481995","amp;dn":"BBC.Lost.Land.of.the.Volcano.2of3.HDTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb728b6fb47a7bee20fb6824cc6b13fa39481995","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,114,139,111,180,122,123,238,32,251,104,36,204,107,19,250,57,72,25,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
