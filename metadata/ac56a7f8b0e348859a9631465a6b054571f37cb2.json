He was the most famous member of the Notre Dame school of polyphony. He was one of very few composers of his day whose name has been preserved, and can be reliably attached to individual compositions; this is due to the testimony of an anonymous English student at Notre Dame known as Anonymous IV, who wrote about him and his predecessor LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©onin. Anonymous IV called him &quot;Perotin Magister&quot;, which means &quot;PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rotin the master or expert.&quot; The name PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rotin is itself derived from &quot;Perotinus,&quot; the Latin diminutive of Petrus, the Latin version of the French name Pierre.\n\nPerotin / The Hilliard Ensemble [ORIGINAL RECORDING REISSUED]\n\nPaul Hillier Bass\nCharles Daniels Tenor\nDavid James Countertenor\nThe Hilliard Ensemble \nJohn Potter Tenor\nRogers Covey-Crump  Tenor\nGordon Jones Baritone\nMark Padmore Tenor\n\nTitleS  \t\n1.
