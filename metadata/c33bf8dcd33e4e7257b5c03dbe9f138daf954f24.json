I hope it won't be deleted for no reason again!\n\n\nAt first, I would like to thank rrodger99 for uploading the AOA 767 DVD. THANKS!!\n\nHowever, 5.08GB is still qite a bit. ;) That's why I decided to recode the videos.\nThe result - all three videos in acceptable quality. As quality ensurance, you can download a 1 minute sample file, and decide if it's good enough or not.\n\nThis upload icludes also the areonautical charts used during the videos, as well as the 767-300ER Fuel Planner.\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c33bf8dcd33e4e7257b5c03dbe9f138daf954f24","amp;dn":"FS2004+-+Angle+of+Attack+Level+D+767+Training+Videos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c33bf8dcd33e4e7257b5c03dbe9f138daf954f24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,59,248,220,211,62,78,114,87,181,192,61,190,159,19,141,175,149,79,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
