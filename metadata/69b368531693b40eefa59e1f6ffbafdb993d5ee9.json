Rachel was previously nurse to the girls' fatally ill mother, Lilian (Maya Massar), who died in a fire. The fire, and their mother's death, has caused Anna to have psychological problems and be admitted to a psychiatric ward after a suicide attempt. She has a number of dreams and visions, some of them about a red-haired girl who has died (in one dream she finds the body) and two boys. Other dreams relate to her mother, to other incidents that happened around the time of the fire, and to the fire itself, which she was very close to but cannot recall. She gradually remembers pieces of events, but not the whole story.\n\nBy the time that Anna is released, Rachel and her father have started a relationship. Alex is angry that Anna left her behind and says that the least Anna could do was answer her letters. Anna tells her she never got any letters from her and suggests that maybe it was her doctor who didn't give them to her. Alex says that it wasn't and goes to confront their father about it, but he doesn't listen to her. There is instant animosity between the girls and Rachel. Meanwhile, Matt, who was Anna's boyfriend at the time of the fire and is still on good terms with her, tells Anna that he knows what happened with the fire. He does not want to tell her in front of Rachel, and arranges to meet Anna and Alex that night near their house. They wait for him but he does not arrive. Later, he climbs into Anna's window, but it soon becomes apparent that he is in fact a ghost. When Anna wakes up the next morning, she finds that Matt has been found dead near where they agreed to meet after a deadly fall broke his back. Anna believes that Rachel was the one who pushed him off the cliff after remembering that Rachel had overheard the conversation between her and Matt.\n\nThe girls look into Rachel's past and discover that she cannot be who she claims to be after finding an article about three children who were murdered by Mildred Kemp, their nanny. The report says that the kids were heavily sedated before being stabbed to death and that Mildred was never found. They also suspect that Rachel is using a false identity and they start to believe that she was responsible for the fire (especially given Matt's demise when he was about to tell her), but cannot prove it and are unable to convince their father, who is besotted with Rachel.\n\nThe story comes to a head when their father has to go away, leaving Rachel and the girls on their own. Convinced that Rachel is truly evil, Anna and Alex scheme to get enough evidence against her. However, during one of their attempts, Anna finds Alex lying on the floor after being drugged by Rachel. Anna rushes to the sheriff's station for help. The sheriff (Kevin McNulty) tells her to wait there and Anna falls asleep on the couch. She ends up dreaming about her mother and wakes up to Rachel standing over her. Anna screams for help, but the sheriff holds her down while Rachel injects her with a sedative. Once the drug takes effect, she takes Anna home and Anna starts waking up just as they arrive back at the house.\n\nRachel carries Anna upstairs to her room and starts dressing her for bed. Anna manages to escape from Rachel and later on when she is outside, she sees Alex standing in the driveway, bloody and holding a knife. Alex told her that she had to do it and Anna opens the dumpster that has blood dripping out of it and sees Rachel in there, dead from stab wounds. Anna and Alex hug each other and Anna tells her that everything is going to be okay. Just then, their father drives up and sees them covered in blood. He asks what happened and Anna tells Alex to tell their father what happened.\n\nTheir father is confused and asks what she is talking about. Anna tells Alex again to tell their father what happened. Her father tells her that Alex is dead and that she died the previous year in the same fire that killed their mother. Alex screams at Anna to not listen to him. Anna looks down to where she was holding Alex's hand, but she is actually holding the knife. At that moment, it is revealed that the reason why their father didn't answer Alex about the letters was because he couldn't see her. It is also revealed that Matt was killed by Anna who let him drop off the cliff after he begged her to not let go of him after he confronted her about what happened the night of the fire. Alex has only been around as a figment of Anna's imagination and it was Anna who really murdered Rachel.\n\nAt the end of the film, Anna is arrested and taken back to the psychiatric ward. The police tell Steven that Rachel's name really was an alias. He tells them that she changed her name after leaving an abusive boyfriend. While at the psychiatric ward, another female patient that likes to hang around Anna and &quot;tell her stories&quot; stops by her door, and is shown holding the pearl necklace in her right hand. She says &quot;Welcome home&quot; to Anna, and closes her door shut, revealing her to be Mildred Kemp, as shown on her room door.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0815245/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0815245/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPLEASE SEED AND ENJOY THANKS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69b368531693b40eefa59e1f6ffbafdb993d5ee9","amp;dn":"THE-UNINVITED.2009.DVDrip%5Bvice%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69b368531693b40eefa59e1f6ffbafdb993d5ee9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,179,104,83,22,147,180,14,239,165,158,31,111,251,175,219,153,61,94,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
