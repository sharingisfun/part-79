Married to his cellphone and chain-smoking\n     his way through endless rounds of meetings and crises, he\n     maintains his sense of humour despite incessant demands from\n     the difficult Swedish auteur he has always wanted to produce\n     and the arrival of a group from Korea doing preproduction\n     work on a new film. In addition to massaging artistic egos,\n     his job involves trying to keep one step ahead of his bank\n     and financing is always an interminable headache. When his\n     wife, Sylvia, insists that he join the family on an Italian\n     holiday, Gregoire finds he can no longer maintain any sane\n     balance. Returning to Paris, he confronts the biggest \n     challenge of his career  with unexpected consequences. \n   \n    &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1356928/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1356928/&lt;/a&gt;\n   \n    \n     \n     \n             ..
