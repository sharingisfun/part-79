This is round 1 of 4 of the Live March match-up between The Dragons and The Pirates.\n\nThe Dragons are led by DragonLily with rookie Holly Heart on board. This team is big and strong. Both these girls are new to the Tag Team league and it's rules. Dragon is a 7 season veteran and is looking to win her first Championship. \n\nThe Pirates are led by Dia Zerva, a former Tag Team Champion. This year she has rookie sensation Jessie Cox on her team. This team is fit and has amazing endurance. The Pirates are looking for their second championship in three years.\n\nGreat action as The Dragon and Dia meet for the first time on the US mat. But it is the rookies that will make the difference in this match up. Will the experience of the Pirates over come the size of the Dragons? After the first round only 66pts separate these two great teams.\n\n\n\nScreens &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.ultimatesurrender.com/site/shoot.jsp?shootId=8761&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.ultimatesurrender.com/site/shoot.jsp?shootId=8761&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheers  :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:185a442d0832391591fbc0edb8e48293102d7b46","amp;dn":"Cyber+Update+Apr.2010-------US-8761+DragonLily+Holly+Heart-D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"185a442d0832391591fbc0edb8e48293102d7b46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,90,68,45,8,50,57,21,145,251,192,237,184,228,130,147,16,45,123,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
