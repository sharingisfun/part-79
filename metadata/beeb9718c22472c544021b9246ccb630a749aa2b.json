Most of the source code is under the GNU LGPL license. The unRAR code is under a mixed license: GNU LGPL + unRAR restrictions. \n\nYou can use 7-Zip on any computer, including a computer in a commercial organization. You don't need to register or pay for 7-Zip.\n\n\nThe main features of 7-Zip\n\nHigh compression ratio in new 7z format with LZMA compression\n\nSupported formats:\nPacking / unpacking: 7z, ZIP, GZIP, BZIP2 and TAR\nUnpacking only: ARJ, CAB, CHM, CPIO, DEB, DMG, HFS, ISO, LZH, LZMA, MSI, NSIS, RAR, RPM, UDF, WIM, XAR and Z.\n\nFor ZIP and GZIP formats, 7-Zip provides a compression ratio that is 2-10 % better than the ratio provided by PKZip and WinZip\n\nStrong AES-256 encryption in 7z and ZIP formats\n\nSelf-extracting capability for 7z format\n\nIntegration with Windows Shell\n\nPowerful File Manager\n\nPowerful command line version\n\nPlugin for FAR Manager\n\nLocalizations for 74 languages\n\n\n7-Zip works in Windows 7 / Vista / XP / 2008 / 2003 / 2000 / NT / ME / 98.\nThere is a port of the command line version to Linux/Unix.\n\nOn 7-Zip's Source Forge Page you can find a forum, bug reports, and feature request systems.\n\n\nCompression ratio\n\nCompression ratio results are very dependent upon the data used for the tests. Usually, 7-Zip compresses to 7z format 30-70% better than to zip format.\nAnd 7-Zip compresses to zip format 2-10% better than most of other zip compatible programs.\n\n\nChangelog:\n\n\n9.13 beta      2010-04-15\n-------------------------\n- 7-Zip now stores NTFS file timestamps to ZIP archives.\n- New additional &quot;Open archive &gt;&quot; item in context menu allows to select \n  archive type for some files.\n- Some bugs were fixed.\n- New localization: Uyghur.\n\n\n9.12 beta      2010-03-24\n-------------------------\n- ZIP / PPMd compression ratio was improved in Maximum and Ultra modes.\n- The BUG in 7-Zip 9.* beta was fixed: LZMA2 codec didn't work,\n  if more than 10 threads were used (or more than 20 threads in some modes).\n\n\n9.11 beta      2010-03-15\n-------------------------\n- 7-Zip now supports PPMd compression in ZIP archives.\n- Speed optimizations in PPMd codec.\n- The support for archives in installers was improved.\n- Some bugs were fixed.\n- New localization: Kazakh.\n   \n\n9.10 beta      2009-12-22\n-------------------------\n- The BUG in 7-Zip 9.09 beta was fixed:\n    7-Zip created incorrect ZIP archives, if ZipCrypto encryption was used.\n    \n\n9.09 beta      2009-12-12\n-------------------------\n- 7-Zip now can unpack Apple Partition Map (APM) disk images.\n- Speed optimizations in AES code for Intel's 32nm CPUs.\n- Speed optimizations in CRC calculation code for Intel's Atom CPUs.\n- Some bugs were fixed.\n\n\n\nDon't use this beta version for important data.\nCall &quot;Test&quot; command after each compressing operation. \n\n\nED2K Link:\ned2k://|file|7z913-x64.msi|1327616|DCAAB93C0F1CD578DF68EA02FBD66613|h=AGFHZOG5Z2C3IX622A2NWWM6OB72JZ6Y|/\n\n\nComments from the uploader (olofolleola4):\nHere is some links if you cannot download it through this torrent:\nupload box  .  com  /  files  /  95b87f40ff\nrapid share  .  com  /  files  /  376339263  /  7z913-x64.msi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:beeb9718c22472c544021b9246ccb630a749aa2b","amp;dn":"7-Zip+9.13+Beta+%28x64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"beeb9718c22472c544021b9246ccb630a749aa2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,235,151,24,194,36,114,197,68,2,27,146,70,204,182,48,167,73,170,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
