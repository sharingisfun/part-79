It not only forages in the annals of great popular music, but focuses on the new styles of music Quentin has found for his latest movie, Inglourious Basterds.\n\nThe programme also features contributions from Mary Wilson of the Supremes, the Dusty Springfield's manager Vicki Wickham, film producer Laurence Bender, music and film critic Paul Gambaccini, film editor Sally Menke and music supervisors Mary Ramos and Karyn Rachtman.\n\nA Heavy Entertainment production for BBC Radio 4.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEnjoy!!!\n\nPart 2 coming soon...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e6056778139e76e6020751133204759b8901cac","amp;dn":"BBC+R4+-+Tarantino%5C%27s+Jukebox+Part+1%2F2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e6056778139e76e6020751133204759b8901cac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,96,86,119,129,57,231,110,96,32,117,17,51,32,71,89,184,144,28,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
