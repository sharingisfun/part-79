The first series originally aired in 2002 as Paradise Heights. Sadly a new season was not to be, perhaps deemed not as successful as it should have been but I enjoyed it, finding it very entertaining.\n\nI recorded this through the PC at the time it aired but the copy isn't brilliant as the Dazzle unit I used in those days wasn't too hot.\nHowever it is watchable on the PC (just about) and it was never released on DVD to my knowledge.\nThis offering presents the final three episodes \nEnjoy and please ensure you help to seed this if indeed there are any takers in the first place.\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379107/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379107/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nStarring Charles Dale, Neil Morrissey and Ralf Little\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6eb461865a5a8e06edbefe440d06544aeaa586c4","amp;dn":"The+Eustace+Brothers+%282003%29+Episodes+4-6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6eb461865a5a8e06edbefe440d06544aeaa586c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,180,97,134,90,90,142,6,237,190,254,68,13,6,84,74,234,165,134,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
