Whether you are simply editing text, building applications, maintaining databases, or constructing websites, UEStudio's stunning array of innovative features offers the functionality of a bonafide IDE at an unsurpassed value.\n\n&quot;UEStudio ... adds a stunning array of features to an already extremely powerful text editor. In fact, UEStudio goes far beyond a text editor. It's a true integrated development environment (IDE)...&quot;\n- IMCO Software Reviews\nMore testimonials...\n\nA significant element of a powerful IDE is a programmer's editor or code editor. It serves as the core foundation of any IDE. UEStudio is built on the chassis of the renowned UltraEdit. As such, the program's backbone is highly seasoned, stable, and already proven as the defacto standard of text and programmer's editors.\n\nBecause UltraEdit is so powerful, many of our users already use it as an IDE and have provided us feature requests to extend that functionality. Together, we have taken those requests, our own ideas, and the concept of a supercharged IDE and produced what we consider to be a powerful application with new and exciting features such as native support for over 30 popular compilers, integrated CVS version control, built-in class browsing, language intelligence (like Intellisense), project converter, batch builder, and an integrated debugger to name just a few!\n\nMore infos at\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ultraedit.com/products/uestudio.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ultraedit.com/products/uestudio.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nThe Portable SFX EXE file is built up using WinRAR. You can use it to extract the files and check them one by one if you want to be sure of what is running on your machine.\n\n\nThis has also been built on an XP x86 machine, I don't know if this program can run on a x64 or Vista machine. I't's up to you to check it if you are using them.\n\n\n\nSUGGESTIONS ON USING P2P DOWNLOADS\n==================================\n\n1) It's always better to run all downloaded programs using Sandboxie or a similar virtual machine until you are sure they are clean.\n\n\n2) When in doubt, scan them with an Internet Scan service as the ones provided by Jotti and VirusTotal\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://virusscan.jotti.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://virusscan.jotti.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis will ***NOT*** give you any warranty that a file passing their analysis is clean, nor that if they see them as a troian it's so or not just another false positive, but helps you to decide and at least ask for help or infos.\n\n\n3) Remember, trust nobody, and when in doubt, go to point 1) \n\n\n4) If you find any upload containing trojans or whatsoever malicious or unclean, instead of start cursing in the comments of the upload, take the time to go to the Suprbay Forum at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?f=34&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?f=34&lt;/a&gt;\n\nand report links and comments there, and someone will take care of all the nasties.\n\n\nThat's the only way to keep TPB and its uploads fresh and clean.\n\n\nThat's for what is regarding security. If after testing it you see that you like it and it's useful for you, show your support by buying it!\n\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01628f0f1ae2b183afd1aeb9a715e37084a07b13","amp;dn":"IDM+UltraEdit+Studio+v9.20+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01628f0f1ae2b183afd1aeb9a715e37084a07b13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,98,143,15,26,226,177,131,175,209,174,185,167,21,227,112,132,160,123,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
