The files should be opened in winamp or iTunes software.\n\n\n&quot;one hour before the trip&quot;, a project that features musicians, engineers and visual artists, tries to combine the &quot;indy&quot; - as in independence - mentality and musical approach with the technical self-sufficiency in terms of equipment, facilities and manpower, that members of the project consider a vital prerequisite for the term &quot;independence&quot; to have any essential meaning.
