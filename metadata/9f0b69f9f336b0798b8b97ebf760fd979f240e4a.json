It has no official relation to the band itself, but was started as, and continues to be, a project by a number of Sublime's fans. It was started in the 1990s with 14 tracks, and has now grown to 102.\n\nTo quote one of its creators, &quot;Matt Maguire&quot;, &quot;The type of question I hate to hear is &quot;What bands sound like Sublime? Ever hear Pepper, O.A.R....?&quot;Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½ That is the wrong perspective and only leads to following derivatives of music, simplifying music to pop-Sublime - any band with a crooning voice and a taste of surf-guitar. It's far more important to ask &quot;What bands did Sublime sound like?&quot;Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½ - which will move you up in your musical knowledge and broaden your chance for discovery. Rewind Selector attempts to rewire the biggest fans of Sublime into bigger fans of music, teaching them where Sublime got its roots, and hopefully finding several more favorite bands for each person who takes the time to listen.&quot;\n\nTrack listing\n\nRewind Selector currently consists of 100 remixed Sublime songs, an &quot;Intro&quot;, and an &quot;Outro.&quot;\n\n1.
