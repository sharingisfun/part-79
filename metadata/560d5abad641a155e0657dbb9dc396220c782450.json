And the more with learn, the worse it getsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nDrilling permits and environmental waivers continue to be granted even after ObamaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s moratorium. BP thumbs their nose at the EPA over use of toxic dispersants. The worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s largest environmental group is in bed with BP. Tough talk from Interior Secretary Ken Salazar: &quot;If we find they're not doing what they're supposed to be doing, we'll push them out of the way appropriatelyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but when?! Louisiana will move forward without the feds on building sand berms.\n\nMeanwhile, BPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbeyond petroleumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ greenwashing blows up in its face. And Sarah Palin steps in it when it comes to what political party receives the most cash from Big Oil (was there ever any doubt?).\n\nRand Paul joins Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan (1996) and Saudi Arabia's Prince Bandar (2003) as only the third major guest to back out of a Meet The Press appearance in 62 years.\n\nRand Paul and Tea Partiers also have some conservatives worriedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Sen. Bob Bennett of Utah warns against their negative sloganeering and The American ConservativeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Robert Locke deems libertarianism as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Marxism of the RightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nPaul Krugman: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re as mad as hell, and theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not going to take this anymore. Am I talking about the Tea Partiers? No, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m talking about the corporations.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nAlso, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not just Texas in the news for screwing with schools, a Virginia principle is on leave after plastic fetuses were handed out to third, forth and fifth graders. Chicken costumes within 100 feet of Nevada polling places have been banned. And is Viagra for women just around the corner?\n\nThese stories, your calls, and much more on todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Randi Rhodes Show!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:560d5abad641a155e0657dbb9dc396220c782450","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+May+24+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"560d5abad641a155e0657dbb9dc396220c782450","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,13,90,186,214,65,161,85,224,101,125,187,157,195,150,34,12,120,36,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
