This was a multi-disciplinary microgravity and Earth science research mission with a multitude of international scientific investigations conducted continuously during 16 days in orbit.\n\nThe seven-member crew died on February 1, 2003 when the shuttle disintegrated during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. The cause of the accident was determined to be a piece of foam that broke off during launch and damaged the thermal protection system components (reinforced carbon-carbon panels and thermal protection tiles) on the leading edge of the left wing of the Shuttle orbiter, causing an extensive heat build-up. During re-entry the damaged wing slowly overheated and came apart, eventually leading to loss of control and total disintegration of the vehicle.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04a342b66ad4b1578afdd64230e36f69140f1f48","amp;dn":"Sixteen+Days+-+Columbias+Final+Mission+%28physixmaster%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04a342b66ad4b1578afdd64230e36f69140f1f48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,163,66,182,106,212,177,87,138,253,214,66,48,227,111,105,20,15,31,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
