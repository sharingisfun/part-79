When the killers are caught, Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx), a hotshot young Philadelphia prosecutor, is assigned to the case. Over his objections, Nick is forced by his boss to offer one of the suspects a light sentence in exchange for testifying against his accomplice. Fast forward ten years. The man who got away with murder is found dead and Clyde Shelton coolly admits his guilt. Then he issues a warning to Nick: Either fix the flawed justice system that failed his family, or key players in the trial will die.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1197624/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1197624/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://moviefox.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://moviefox.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67bf34e6b0aa14b8b13e3fed5d64e8917c6a3aef","amp;dn":"Law.Abiding.Citizen.PROPER.XViD.CAM-nDn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67bf34e6b0aa14b8b13e3fed5d64e8917c6a3aef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,191,52,230,176,170,20,184,177,62,63,237,93,100,232,145,124,106,58,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
