V6/A10. \n\nHelp me seed (to a ratio of at least 2.0) &amp; get these 'out there' - I have a max. upload speed of c. 80k/s. \n\nThe more help I get the quicker everyone gets them. \n\nIt's a team effort. Please do your part. \n\nUntil I see enough seeding of previous episodes, I won't be allowing anyone to get more than 98% of these episodes.
