The reason is because instead \nof going directly from DVD+R to AVI, I went from \nDVD+R to VOB to AVI. \n\nMaking a singular VOB file copy from the original \ndisc saved hours of use on my DVD burner that I \nread the discs from. But it also lowered the quality, \nso I won't be using it anymore.\n\nGuest stars are William Shatner and Strother Martin.\n\nThat picture you see which I found in a Google search\nof Shatner and Doug McClure is actually from 10 years\nlater from an episode of their TV series\nThe Barbary Coast.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30858f31dbd77db95783662d93ee1e2f16137a71","amp;dn":"THE+VIRGINIAN+--+The+Claim+%28+4th+Season+%29+with+William+Shatner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30858f31dbd77db95783662d93ee1e2f16137a71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,133,143,49,219,215,125,185,87,131,102,45,147,238,30,47,22,19,122,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
