Sonic &amp; SEGA All-Stars Racing is a fast and furious battle to the finish line. In a frantic battle to the checkered flag, Sonic &amp; SEGA All-Stars Racing sees Sonic and friends speed around tracks set in medieval castle ramparts, lush rain forests and bustling cities, all taken from the visually rich and varied universes of Sonic and SEGA. Fan favorites such as Dr. Eggman, Tails, AiAi, Amigo and many more will join Sonic in their custom built vehicles, revving their engines and jostling to stay ahead of the pack. Each character will race around the track in cars, planes, motorbikes, and in AiAi's case -- a banana mobile! Secret short cuts, swift handling and avoiding strategically placed obstacles are certainly the best way to get to the top of the podium.  \n\n\nNOTE: To play this game you need a chipped or soft modded Wii.\n\nTo install &amp; play off disc:\n1.
