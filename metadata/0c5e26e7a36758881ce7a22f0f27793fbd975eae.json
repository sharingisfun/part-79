As a boy in Jerusalem's Lot, ME, Ben Mears (Rob Lowe) took a dare and broke into a local mansion called the Marsten House. There, he had the misfortune of discovering the corpses resulting from a scandalous murder/suicide. Decades later, he returns to find that a mysterious antiques dealer (Donald Sutherland) and his unseen business partner (Rutger Hauer) have moved into the Marsten House. Soon, townspeople begin disappearing and dying, only to return, floating outside the windows of their loved ones and begging to be let in. Only Ben and a few newfound allies suspect the awful truth: that something unholy has overtaken their town...something with links to the sinister mansion of Ben's nightmares. Originally broadcast June 20 and 21, 2004, on the TNT cable network, Salem's Lot was scripted by Peter Filardi, who previously penned The Craft and Flatliners. Shot on-location in Australia, this is the second television adaptation of Salem's Lot, and it follows Tobe Hooper's 1979 version. Hauer and Sutherland are old vampire buddies, having previously co-starred in the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer film.\n\n\nMpaa Rating++++++++++\n\nN/A \n\n\nRetail Release Date++++++++\n\n20 June 2004\n\nDVD Content++++++++++\n\n\nMain Movie+++++++++++++++\n+Video- CCE Encoded - 5 passes\n+Audio-English\n+Subs-English, French, Spanish\n\n\nMenu+++++++\n+Yes \n\nExtras/Special Features+++++\n+Yes\n\nRemoved++++++++++++++\nFBI crap and trailers and all of the other annoying and useless stuff.\n\n\n\nChapters++++++++++++++\n\n1.
