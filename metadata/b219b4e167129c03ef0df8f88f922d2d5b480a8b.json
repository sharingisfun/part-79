What it does do, is offload certain parts of the     \n        game to a server, game then requests those things at runtime.   \n        These parts can be anything that the developer wants. In the    \n        case with Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands, those things   \n        were:                                                           \n                                                                        \n        - Levers logic                                                  \n        - Door timing                                                   \n        - Upgrades                                                      \n        - Abilities                                                     \n        - XP &amp; Levels                                                   \n        - Area codes                                                    \n                                                                        \n        Every time you step on a button &quot;in game&quot;, it sends a request   \n        to server asking what to do. Server then sends the door code    \n        to open, including how much time it stays open. Levers work     \n        similarly, every time you press the &quot;TAB&quot; button to display     \n        skills, game asks again server: &quot;What skills do player have&quot;,   \n        and so on and on.                                               \n                                                                        \n        All that stuff takes a lot of time to implement right and we    \n        do implement it like the original do. All our doors open and    \n        close with exact same time factors as the retail do. We just    \n        wanted to clarify a little how the Ubisoft DRM really does      \n        work, because a lot of those individuals we mentioned in the    \n        beginning of this statement didn't seem to understand, yet      \n        what kind of monster this is. It's not some simply &quot;Values&quot;     \n        going around like it were with Assassin's Creed II.             \n\n                                                                        \n        On with the game release information:                           \n                                                                        \n        Prince of Persia The Forgotten Sands is the next chapter in     \n        the fan-favorite Sands of Time universe. Visiting his           \n        brother's kingdom following his adventure in Azad, the Prince   \n        finds the royal palace under siege from a mighty army bent on   \n        its destruction. When the decision is made to use the ancient   \n        power of the Sand in a desperate gamble to save the kingdom     \n        from total annihilation, the Prince will embark on an epic      \n        adventure in which he will learn to bear the mantle of true     \n        leadership, and discover that great power often comes with a    \n        great cost.
