The FL Studio philosophy is creative freedom:\n\nFree your audio - Route any instrument to any mixer track. Each mixer track can receive audio from any number of instruments, any number of other mixer tracks and a soundcard input. Mixer tracks, in turn, can send audio to any number of other mixer tracks and a soundcard output. Create sub-mixes, effects chains or complex mixes. FL studios flexible architecture sets audio free.\n\n\nFree your mind - Choose your preferred workflow, compose using the step-sequencer or piano roll. Create in pattern or track mode, then arrange your ideas in the free palette Playlist. The Playlist presents timeline as a virtual canvas where each Playlist track can simultaneously hold any number of score, audio and automation events. Now thats freedom.\n\nMake virtually any sound - FL9 includes over 30 software synthesizers covering acoustic/synthetic bass, electric guitar, multi-sampler tools including piano &amp; strings, general sample playback and beat-slicing (With Rex 1 &amp; 2 support).\n\nSynthesis techniques - span subtractive, modelling, FM, RM, granular and additive. With the addition of FL SynthMaker you can further create &amp; share your own FL instruments, effects &amp; MIDI control dashboards without the need to write basic code.\n\nAudio Recording &amp; Editing\n\nMulti-channel audio inputs - With the ability to simultaneously capture all the inputs on your audio-interface, FL Studio has the flexibility to record a single vocalist, guitar or a full symphony orchestra.\n\nArranging audio - Audio can be arranged, with complete freedom in the Playlist.
