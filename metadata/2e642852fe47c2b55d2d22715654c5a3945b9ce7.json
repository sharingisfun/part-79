When Ben, Gwen, and Kevin investigate, they meet Paradox, a scientist from the 1950s who was sucked into the event horizon of his time-travel experiment. Displaced from time and space, Paradox has existed for 100,000 years and is able to move through time at will. However, the same mistake that rendered him ageless created the creature they seek. Ben realizes that the creature is not acting like a monster, but a confused person, and has Paradox take them back to the day of the accident. There, as Humungousaur Ben rescues Paradox's assistant, Hugo, nullifying the creature's existence. In the present, the now old Hugo joins Paradox in exploring time and space.\n\n111 - Be-Knighted\nKevin arranged a meeting for Ben with the Forever Knights, who need help in slaying a dragon they have kept captive underneath their castle for 1,000 years. Slaying the dragon is the very reason their organization exists. After a failed attempt, in which the dragon appears to be trying to communicate, they track it to a warehouse where its spaceship is being held. Ben fits the dragon with a translator as Spidermonkey so it can speak, and it reveals that it was a mapmaker before being captured. Angry after a millennium of imprisonment, the dragon arms itself to fight back. Ben convinces it to leave peacefully. Though the Knights believe to have lost their purpose, the news that a world full of dragons exists renews their pledge, as does their need to exact revenge on those who allowed it to return home.\n\n112 - Plumbers' Helpers\nA pair of rogue plumbers, a female Kineceleran named Helen and a male Tetramand named Manny, kidnap Kevin, believing him to be an alien. After his rescue, the two sides work things out. After looking at a database of the aliens they captured and put into the Null Void, Ben realizes that some of them may have been Plumbers' kids. To make things right, the duo set out into the Null Void to rescue those they wrongfully imprisoned.\n\n113 - X=Ben+2\nThe Incusion Emperor Milleous plans to destroy the Earth for kidnapping his daughter Attea. During their search, Ben uses the untested Alien X form to fix a broken dam. Though the task proves simple thanks to Alien X's reality-warping abilities, Ben finds himself locked in debate with the other two personalities inside the alien, unable to move or transform back without their consent. In the meantime, Kevin and Gwen have to protect Ben while trying to save the Earth. Ben, tired of the fruitless debate, demands to be transformed into another alien which can actually get the job done. He manages to save the Earth with Swampfire, but resolves never to use Alien X again.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease share....Don't hit and run...Seed it back at least once.\n\nOf course, if you want to seed it back more than once, that would be ok too :)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e642852fe47c2b55d2d22715654c5a3945b9ce7","amp;dn":"Ben+10%3A+Alien+Force+-+Volume+3+%282008%29+DVDRip+Eng+Xvid+AC3+AVI+%5BB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e642852fe47c2b55d2d22715654c5a3945b9ce7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,100,40,82,254,71,194,181,93,45,34,113,86,84,197,163,148,91,156,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
