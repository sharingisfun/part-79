Now Ethaniel must learn about our world: how we think and how we relate to each other. Dr. Laura Keating assists Ethaniel in his understanding of the &quot;human&quot; way while he pursues Banning. Ethaniel knows Banning's secret goal lies in the brain of Thorber, Ethaniel's missing brother. A brilliant scientist, Thorber originally worked with Banning but fled after discovering Banning's real scheme: the ultimate destruction of all human life on earth. Joined by Byder, a rebel hooked on conspiracy theories, Ethaniel and Dr. Laura Keating set out on their mission. Forging a powerful interspecies alliance, Laura and Ethaniel risk their lives. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190174/plotsummary&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190174/plotsummary&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:064092a46fb6b9cdd58072bd3a172fab2c66b6ab","amp;dn":"Code+Name+Eternity+-+Complete+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"064092a46fb6b9cdd58072bd3a172fab2c66b6ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,64,146,164,111,182,185,205,213,128,114,189,58,23,47,171,44,102,182,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
