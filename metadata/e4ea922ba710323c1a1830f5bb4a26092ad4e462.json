Tony is the protector of an artifact that mercenaries are seeking to get at any cost. Joining Tony is his mentor Panna Rittikrai and the team that brought us Ong Bak, The Protector, Born to Fight and Dynamite Warrior. The action segments were so enormous that a total of three stunt teams were called in to handle it all!\n\nTony Jaa (star of the critically Ong-Bak &amp; Warrior King) is the leader of the Panter Squad - a group of martial arts madmen employed by a notorious General and Cartel kingpin on the border of Thailand and The Golden Triangle. They have kidnapped a noted Explorer who has been searching for an ancient priceless artefact that the General is desperate to find and profit from.\n\nA team of ruthless mercenaries leads a crack team to free the Explorer, crush the General and JaaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s deadly Panther squad. But before doing so they must overcome the fearsome Black Goblins and the crazed Kung Fu Zombies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4ea922ba710323c1a1830f5bb4a26092ad4e462","amp;dn":"Battle+Warrior+%28Tony+Jaa%29+English+%5BThai+Movie%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4ea922ba710323c1a1830f5bb4a26092ad4e462","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,234,146,43,167,16,50,60,26,24,48,245,187,74,38,9,42,212,228,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
