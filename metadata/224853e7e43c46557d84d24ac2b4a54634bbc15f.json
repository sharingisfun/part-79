Lucinda, an odd child who hears         \n voices, swiftly writes a long string of numbers. In 2009, the capsule is     \n opened; student Caleb Koestler gets Lucinda's &quot;drawing&quot; and his father       \n John, an astrophysicist and grieving widower, takes a look. He discovers     \n dates of disasters over the past 50 years with the number who died. Three    \n dates remain, all coming soon. He investigates, learns of Lucinda, and       \n looks for her family. He fears for his son, who's started to hear voices     \n and who is visited by a silent stranger who shows him a vision of fire and   \n destruction. What's going on?                                                \n                                                                              \n\n\n                           Happy Hacker Industries                            \nThis movie should play fine on most DVD/DivX Certified settop\ndvd players.
