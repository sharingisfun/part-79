The human body lies at the root of projects that formally and conceptually chart identity and its construction as a preamble to broaching matters of violence, genders, memory, loss or ideology in which personal experiences co-exists with references to popular culture, the media and consumerism. Specializing in digital technologies, he aims to mix genres and ways of expression to explore the potential of audio visual media.\n\nCurrently based MalmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ in the south of Sweden and has exhibited at numerous art/film festivals, galleries, and museums internationally, including:\nCape 09 Art Biennale, 2009, Cape Town, South Africa; Biennale of Sydney 2008, Sydney, Australia; National Museum, Szczecin, Poland; Transmediale08, Berlin, Germany; File Brazil 07-08, SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o Paulo, Brazil; [10th] Japan Media Arts Festival, Tokyo, Japan; 13th Barcelona International Festival of Advanced Music and Multimedia Art, SONAR, Barcelona, Spain; Scope New York, US; Museum of Contemporary Art (MAC), Santa Fe, Argentina; Pocket Films , Centre Pompidou, Paris; Videoformes, Clermont ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Ferrand, France and EMAF, European Media Art Festival,OsnabrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ck, Germany.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af2f2bf80387c0f60a4c1ee07573a9a3eda91e31","amp;dn":"090909%5B2009%5Dby.Anders.Weberg.P2P-ART.com.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af2f2bf80387c0f60a4c1ee07573a9a3eda91e31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,47,43,248,3,135,192,246,10,76,30,224,117,115,169,163,237,169,30,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
