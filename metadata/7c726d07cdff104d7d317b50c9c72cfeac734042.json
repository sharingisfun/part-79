Needless to say the quality is fantastic and the performance is truly unique. Being a huge Deep Purple fan and a bit Black Sabbath fan, this was one hell of a line up. Ian Gillan is perhaps the most talented vocalist Sabbath ever toured with, unfortunately the Glenn Hughes line up was so short lived we may never know of their potential. Instead of trying to replace Ozzy or Dio, Ian brought his own unique style to the delivery of the vocals. Ian Gillan doesn't seem in the least bit intimidated working in the legendary Sabbath. Could be because as a member of Deep Purple, he enjoyed far more commercial and public success. A fun and facinating concert. \n\nMakes for an incredibly interesting show, even more so considering they perform &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;!\n\n\nBlack Sabbath live Reading Rock Festival, 27-August-83\n\nTransfer direct from FM master tape (original \nbroadcast recording made 9/3/84 onto Sony BHF \n90 cassette tape)&gt;Ion Tape 2 PC&gt;Audacity 1.3&gt;Wav \n(16 bit)&gt;FLAC (SBE corrected, Trader's Little Helper)\nTransferred 9/09\n\nFLAC encoded level 6 10-09\n\n\n1.Hot Line\n2.War Pigs\n3.Black Sabbath\n4.Zero The Hero\n5.Digital Bitch\n6.Iron Man\n7.Smoke on the Water\n8.Paranoid\n\nTime: 49.16\n\nI really like the short-lived version of \nSabbath with Gillan- and this is a storming \nset- Gillan being in particularly fine voice. \nPerhaps it was an odd choice of pairings, \nbut I'm still kind of glad it happened. \nThis transfer came out very well indeed- \nminimal hiss, and a good, clear sound.\n\nTaped by Owy\n\n \n\nas a bonus, IÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´ve included a very rare cd, the only one released by the band Transcendence, in mp3 320, ITÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´S A VERY NICE ALBUM, PLEASE GIVE IT A TRY:\n\nYear:  2002\nCategory: Metal\nGenre: Progressive metal\nCountry: United States\nLanguage: English\nFormat: MP3 320 kbit/s\n\n1.Endless Reign\n\n2.Echoes\n\n3.No Trace\n\n4.The Wake\n\n5.The Fall Of Meridian\n\n6.Filtered Lenses\n\n7.Set Fire To The Sky\n\n8.Israel\n\n9.Random Light\n\n10.Alpha\n\n11.Omega\n\n\nKINDLY SHARED BY omie FROM http://www.freehardmusic.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c726d07cdff104d7d317b50c9c72cfeac734042","amp;dn":"Black+Sabbath+-+2+lossless+soundboard+shows+with+Gillan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c726d07cdff104d7d317b50c9c72cfeac734042","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,114,109,7,205,255,16,77,125,49,123,80,201,199,44,254,172,115,64,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
