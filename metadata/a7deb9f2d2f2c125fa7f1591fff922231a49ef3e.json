A lot of my music collection came from here, so I decided it's time to share! These two DC4C concert EP's are pretty rare, and I think they might only be on Rhapsody. They're good, they have all the metadata (album art, genre, year, etc. - lack of metadata always bugs me), and I hope that you'll seed!\n\nAlso, if you like Death Cab, check out my music blog. In it you will find other reviews of bands such as Modest Mouse, Dr. Dog, and Jack Johnson. Also, hating on Katy Perry. That was fun post.\n\nFor some reason it's not letting me post the link, though. So it's thecheapcritic.blogspot dot infer the rest.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7deb9f2d2f2c125fa7f1591fff922231a49ef3e","amp;dn":"Two+Rare+Death+Cab+For+Cutie+Live+EP%5C%27s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7deb9f2d2f2c125fa7f1591fff922231a49ef3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,222,185,242,210,242,193,37,250,127,21,145,255,249,34,35,26,73,239,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
