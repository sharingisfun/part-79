They are unable to access the ship's bridge, and cannot communicate with any other members of the crew, including the flight team they are to relieve.[4] While exploring the spacecraft under Payton's radio guidance, Bower encounters several other surviving crew members, and the astronauts start to learn that a terrible event has occurred on board which might have affected the survival of the entire human species.[5]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bead02afc87049e0735fd9cbc50ff876d1c0d426","amp;dn":"Pandorum.2009CAM-FEARR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bead02afc87049e0735fd9cbc50ff876d1c0d426","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,173,2,175,200,112,73,224,115,95,217,203,197,15,248,118,209,192,212,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
