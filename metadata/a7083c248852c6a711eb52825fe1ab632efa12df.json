If you do not clean up very soon, the boss will be mad and you will\nhave to work overtime.\n\nPut the crates and other items back to their places. Take note, that you\ncan only push the items! It is not possible to pull them. Use your mind\nand be clever, because there is always a solution, but sometimes it may be\nhard to find it.\n\nYou will be challenged in 80 levels. The higher the level you are in, the\nharder the task. Sometimes there will obstacles in your way. You have to\nrethink and quickly bypass them to be successful.\n\nCleaning up can be lots of fun, especially when the graphics are so new\nand great! You can use auto-mapping to stay ahead of things. It is even\npossible to create your own levels with the integrated level editor.\n\nStay calm and do your work!\n\nURL: http://www.magnussoft.com/sokoman4en/\nURL: http://www.amazon.de/dp/B001E17E7Q/\n\n/\n/ /\n\n: i :\n::: /::\n:::::: /:: Installation Notes\n\n1.
