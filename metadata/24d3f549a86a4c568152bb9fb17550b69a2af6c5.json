But Ramanand Sagar did it. Story in wich God apier on earth and show his way of living through justice and love code, all ppl shoud wach this once. Placed in ancient time before any todays religion, it shows peek of beauty in human relations and spiritual science. And afcorse a milion other things :) \n\nIts only a shame that dvd colection is not so good as original becuse it has sound modifyed and many scenes cuted (expecialy on 2 first dvd-s) just to fit some Sagars post movie pilgrimages. He was realy famos in India for doing this master piece. Still even today my hearth hurts me when waching dvd version of Ramayan and allwais wondering.. Why for God sake they did lower or complitly erazer music from some scenes!? Why ruining something so wonderfull and unique with such slopy work. Its like ading or removing some colors from Picasso paintings. Dvd version shud be upgraded original, instead, its like ripted off version lol. No wonder Sagar studio soon after broke down. Well anyway.. Meeting Ramayana defenetly change evryones life a bit. I know it did change my. \nDvd version is still beter for todays large/wide tv-s and I dubt ppl wud like my orginal version in vhs quality.\n\nOrginal 16 dvd-s came on 8Gb dvd ones so I cuted Sagars traveling over India and did regular 4.7Gb dvds. (Irony ha =P)\n\nIf you expect Spielberg efects, pass it.. if u expect devotion, dig it..\n\nps: I will added some deleted scenes later. Its embaresing 15y old avi quality but it will do for those who are intrested.\nSori for bad english guys and thx all for seeding :)\n\n\nJay Sri Ram!.. Jay Hanuman!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24d3f549a86a4c568152bb9fb17550b69a2af6c5","amp;dn":"Ramayan+%28dvd1%2F16%2C+eng+sub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24d3f549a86a4c568152bb9fb17550b69a2af6c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,211,245,73,168,106,76,86,129,82,187,159,177,117,80,182,154,42,246,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
