It is largely set in and around a small village by the Sava river at Serbia's border with Austria-Hungary.\n\nThe village is divided between able-bodied men that are potential army recruits and the many invalid veterans from the previous Balkan wars, and there is bitter animosity between the two groups, which don't intermingle much with each other even though they live in the same village.\n\nThe central theme of the movie is a love triangle between the village gendarme ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½orde, his wife Katarina and the young war cripple Gavrilo who once had a love affair with Katarina before he went to war and lost his arm in battle, and with the arm partly also his lust for life. Even though Katarina in the meantime married ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½orde, she still has affection for Gavrilo, which is a source of friction between the two.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55a23a3872b3bbcf163e0e2dfe222db2f58eee21","amp;dn":"St.+George+Shoots+the+Dragon-DVDrip+Draza","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55a23a3872b3bbcf163e0e2dfe222db2f58eee21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,162,58,56,114,179,187,207,22,62,14,45,254,34,45,178,245,142,238,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
