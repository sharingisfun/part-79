Complete with facial features and hairdos, your players are able to perform more feats of aerial derring-do (or is that Depar-dieu?) than the legendary Cirque du Soleil performers. Bicycle kicks, slide tackles, diving headers... all of these are actually possible in the game, and advanced moves such as jumping over a slide tackle or flipping the ball over your opponents' heads can be mastered with a slight bit of practice.\n\nWhile EA is famous for its wealth of options, FIFA 98 offers more options than there are types of Brie at the lovely cheese shops along the historic Champs Elysees. There are hundreds of teams, three difficulty levels, and five different play options, including friendly, league, penalty shots, and the road to the World Cup. Most impressive, though, are the actual team management options in the game, allowing you to choose from multiple formations, player positions, and strategies. More amazingly, you can also adjust each individual player's attack bias and aggression level, choose who takes free and corner kicks, and create or purchase new players to add to your club.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90153ffac7df0c7f8706ed708620bcf7f01ba096","amp;dn":"Fifa+98","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90153ffac7df0c7f8706ed708620bcf7f01ba096","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,21,63,250,199,223,12,127,135,6,237,112,134,32,188,247,240,27,160,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
