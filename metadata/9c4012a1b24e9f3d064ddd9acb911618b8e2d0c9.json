Released in 2004, it features some heavy tracks (like &quot;Terminal Show&quot; and &quot;In the Name of Tragedy&quot;), but also some rock'n'roll tracks (&quot;Killers&quot;, &quot;Life's a Bitch&quot;). &quot;Whorehouse Blues&quot; is an acoustic track, which reflects on the thirty years of MotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rhead's existence. Guitarist Steve Vai plays on &quot;Terminal Show&quot; and &quot;Down on Me&quot;.\n\nIn November 2005, a special, 30th anniversary edition of Inferno was released with a bonus DVD, which contains 6 live tracks from the band's 30th anniversary show, a documentary and the &quot;Whorehouse Blues&quot; video.\n\nThe final song on the album, &quot;Whorehouse Blues&quot;, was somewhat of a departure for the band in terms of influence. It was described as a country blues style song, and was distinguished by the playing of acoustic guitar by all three band members, with Lemmy also taking up harmonica towards the end. Mikkey Dee explained his role change from drums to guitar by saying &quot;I've been playing guitar all my life a little bit, because guitars have always been around, so it's nothing spectacular in my eyes&quot;. He also stated that &quot;it's quite fun to walk onstage and do that song. And we definitely surprised the audiences...&quot; \n\nFilming of the video was due to take place in a Stringfellow's club, but Peter Stringfellow objected to the song title and the associations it brought with it, and withdrew any involvement. With twenty-four hours left until the shoot, they found a club in Ealing.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c4012a1b24e9f3d064ddd9acb911618b8e2d0c9","amp;dn":"Motorhead+-+Whorehouse+Blues+%28Live-Germany%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c4012a1b24e9f3d064ddd9acb911618b8e2d0c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,64,18,161,178,78,159,61,6,77,221,154,203,145,22,24,184,226,208,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
