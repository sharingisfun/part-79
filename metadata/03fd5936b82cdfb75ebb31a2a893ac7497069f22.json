The film raises questions regarding how this theology shapes U.S.- Middle East relations and how it may even encourage an international holy war.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1372746&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1372746&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre: Documentary\nIMDB rating: 6.8/10 (29 votes)\nDirected by: Kate Davis &amp; David Heilbroner\n\n&quot;If behavior does not make sense to others and this behavior cannot be reasonably explained or verbalized by a person, then it may be seen as a form of abnormal behavior or as signs of a mental disorder. The main aspect of this definition is the belief that all behaviors should in some way be explained through a rational reason for their existence.&quot;\n\nHowever, this documentary shows how mental illness can manifest, and how the people, who looks normal (and educated) can support and apply mass-delusion.\n\nMen can't self-diagnose in case of mental illness. And yes, mental illness is - infective disease. On &quot;special&quot; way.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5471113/Religulous.2008.[Bill.Maher].DVDRip.H264&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5471113/Religulous.2008.[Bill.Maher].DVDRip.H264&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03fd5936b82cdfb75ebb31a2a893ac7497069f22","amp;dn":"Waiting.for.Armageddon.2009.272p.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03fd5936b82cdfb75ebb31a2a893ac7497069f22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,253,89,54,184,44,223,183,94,187,49,162,168,147,172,116,151,6,159,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
