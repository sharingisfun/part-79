I don't believe you should have to pay a ridiculous amount to get a second hand version of it so, here it is. I hope you give it a chance &amp; enjoy it as much as I do :)\n\nTaken from the back of the case...\n\n&quot;Thomas Jane (Boogie Nights, Face/Off), Aaron Eckhart (Nurse Betty, Erin Brockovich), Supermodel Paulina Porizkova (Wedding Bell Blues, Her Alibi), and James Le Gros star in a no-holds-barred, erotically charged, thriller that packs a lifetime's worth of action into one day. \n\nCasey Wells (Jane), a former shakedown artist from the mean streets of L.A., has gone straight--or so he thought. When his ex-partner-in-crime (Eckhart) appears one day with a mysterious suitcase, Casey's comfortable suburban life is turned upside down. Suddenly murderous drug dealers, a gorgeous, sexually voracious brunette (Porizkova), and crooked cops are trying to kill him. \n\nIf Casey lives, he may wind up with hidden millions his old pal stole in a drug scam. But if he wants to survive until Friday, Casey's going to have to revert to his old lethal habits.&quot;\n\nDVD FEATURES\n\n*Theatrical Trailer\n\n*Cast Filmographies\n\nTECHNICAL FEATURES\n\n*Letterbox 1.85:1\n\n*English 2.0\n\n*English 5.1\n\n*English Closed Captioned","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d94d3651fee06d71b8410fff25e22253064b8d77","amp;dn":"Thursday+-+Unrated+Director%5C%27s+Cut+%281998%29+DVD+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d94d3651fee06d71b8410fff25e22253064b8d77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,77,54,81,254,224,109,113,184,65,15,255,37,226,34,83,6,75,141,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
