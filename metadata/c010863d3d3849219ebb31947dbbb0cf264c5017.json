The song came out in 1976 on their album Jailbreak. It was honoured with the 499th position among Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Rolling Stone praised lead singer Phil Lynott's &quot;Gaelic soul&quot; and called the &quot;twin-guitar lead by Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson&quot; used &quot;crucial to the song's success&quot;. The song is played at most Irish Rugby matches. In March 2005, Q magazine placed &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot; at number 38 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.\n\nJailbreak is the sixth studio album by Irish hard rock band Thin Lizzy, released in 1976. This album proved to be Thin Lizzy's commercial breakthrough in the U.S. The singles include &quot;Jailbreak&quot; and &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot;, the latter being Thin Lizzy's biggest hit. The band originally wanted to release the more pop-oriented &quot;Running Back&quot; as the first single, which may account for the song's accessible arrangement and production.\n\nOn the 1996 Mercury CD reissue (#314 532 294-2), &quot;Angel from the Coast&quot; and &quot;Running Back&quot; are listed as the second track with only one running time, making it appear to be a single song called &quot;Angel from the Coast Running Back&quot;, and there is no third track listed. But all the songs are sequenced as on the original LP release.\n\nThin Lizzy are an Irish hard rock band who formed in Dublin, Ireland in 1969. The band were led throughout their recording career by bassist, songwriter and singer Phil Lynott, and are best known for their songs &quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot;, &quot;Jailbreak&quot; and &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot;, all major international hits still played regularly on hard rock and classic rock radio stations. After Lynott died, various incarnations of the band have emerged over the years culminating in a more stable line-up based around guitarists Scott Gorham and John Sykes. Sykes left the band in June 2009.\n\nThin Lizzy's leader, Lynott was composer or co-composer of almost all their songs. He was also one of the few black men to achieve significant success in hard rock. As well as being multiracial, the band drew its members not only from both sides of the Irish border but also from both the Catholic and Protestant communities. Their music reflects a wide range of influences, including country music, psychedelic rock, Irish music and traditional Irish folk music, but is generally classified as hard rock or heavy metal.\n\nCritic for allmusic John Dougan has written that &quot;As the band's creative force, Lynott was a more insightful and intelligent writer than many of his ilk, preferring slice-of-life working-class dramas of love and hate influenced by Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, Bruce Springsteen, and virtually all of the Irish literary tradition.&quot; Van Morrison, Jeff Beck and Jimi Hendrix were major influences during the early days of the band, and later influences included American artists Little Feat and Bob Seger.\n\nThin Lizzy were ranked #51 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c010863d3d3849219ebb31947dbbb0cf264c5017","amp;dn":"Thin+Lizzy+-+The+Boys+Are+Back+In+Town+%28Live%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c010863d3d3849219ebb31947dbbb0cf264c5017","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,16,134,61,61,56,73,33,158,187,49,148,125,187,176,207,38,76,80,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
