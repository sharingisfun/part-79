(no Mediacenter, no MediaPlayer, No IE8, no DVD maker.) Keep in mind that the rating system will not be working in this version. This because the &quot;N&quot; has no multimedia support. To have it working you have to install the mediapack from Microsoft. This will reinstall all the packages above and fix the rating issue. (If you ask me, that is a bug that Microsoft should be fix.)\n\n\n[b]Visual Customization: (default)[/b]\n\nSpecial ROG theme\nSystem icons\nSystem sounds\nWallpapers\nMedia center full customization\nMedia player (background changer)\nSystem Fonts (Only ROG THEME)\n\n\n\n\n[b]Default setting and registry setting:[/b]\n\nRemoved the imposed default 100 Mb Partition upon installation.
