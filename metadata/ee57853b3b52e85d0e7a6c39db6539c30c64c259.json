It stars Barry Brown and Jeff Bridges as two of a group of young men that flee the draft during the American Civil War to seek their fortune and freedom on the unforgiving American frontier.\n\nThis acid western attempts in many ways to demythologize the American West in its portrayal of young men forced by circumstance and drawn by romanticized accounts to forge new lives for themselves on the wrong side of the law. Their initial eagerness to be outlaws soon abates, however, when the boys are confronted with the realities of preying on others in a nation ravaged by war and exploitation.\n\nIts engaging performances, graceful direction, and the deftly written WGA-nominated screenplay from Benton and Newman all make this whimsical western perhaps one of the more tender, subtle and effective of the new &quot;realist&quot; Modernist Westerns of the 1960's and 70's.\n\nThe film runs approximately 93 minutes and is rated PG.\n\nA truly excellent realistic western I remember watching as a kid many moons ago. Great to finally see it again.\nIf you liked the recent Assassination of Jesse James, then you will appreciate this authentic and underrated movie.\n\nThis is the UK PAL retail edition. The picture is awfully noisy. Until something better comes along, this will have to do.\n\n\nthanks goes to gildenman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee57853b3b52e85d0e7a6c39db6539c30c64c259","amp;dn":"Bad+Company+1972+DVD5+PAL+VIDEO_TS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee57853b3b52e85d0e7a6c39db6539c30c64c259","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,87,133,59,59,82,232,93,14,122,108,57,219,101,57,195,12,100,194,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
