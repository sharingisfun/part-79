Designed for corporate networks, it defends against external attacks and viruses and can restrict access to websites based on their content.\n\nDeep inspection firewall\nKerio WinRoute Firewall, certified by ICSA Labs in the Corporate Firewall category, includes detailed rule definition to perform stateful inspection and protocol inspection of all outgoing and incoming Internet traffic. A network rules wizard assists in the rapid setup of the firewall.\n\nVPN, VPN Client &amp; SSL VPN\nKerio's built-in SSL-based VPN server works in both client-to-server and server-to-server modes, allowing both branch offices and remote workers to securely connect to the corporate LAN. Clientless SSL VPN allows remote users to connect securely to the corporate network for file sharing from any computer with a browser and Internet connection.\n\nAntivirus gateway protection\nKerio WinRoute Firewall provides optional virus scanning of inbound and outbound email, web traffic, and FTP transfers. In addition to a version with integrated McAfee Anti-Virus, there are several other anti-virus options to choose from.\n\nSurf protection\nThe integrated IBM Orange Web Filter option blocks users from accessing to up to 58 categories of web content, reducing legal liabilities for corporate and educational environments.\n\nContent filtering\nKerio WinRoute Firewall offers a variety of content security features such as MP3 music download blocking, filtering for potentially dangerous executable files or blocking of annoying pop-up windows. The P2P Eliminator automatically detects and blocks peer-to-peer networks such as Kazaa.\n\nUser-specific access management\nEach user in the network can be required to log in to Kerio WinRoute Firewall before connecting to the Internet. That allows for restrictive security and access policies to be applied based on the specific user, rather than the IP address. Transparent Active Directory support simplifies user account mapping to Windows domains, and an auto-add feature allows for creation of user-specific policies before users authenticate.\n\nFast Internet sharing\nSupport for DSL, cable modems, ISDN, satellite, dial-up or wireless Internet allows administrators to deploy Kerio WinRoute Firewall in networks of all sizes and in all locations. Users can share one Internet connection with fail-over to a backup connection. Administrators can use the Bandwidth Limiter to optimise the data throughput for business critical applications.\n\nVoIP and UPnP support\nKerio WinRoute Firewall allows H.323 and SIP protocols to connect through it, eliminating the need to publicly expose the VoIP infrastructure to the Internet. Also, it integrates UPnP technology so that compliant applications such as MSN Messenger run instantly without requiring additional configuration at the firewall.\n\nInternet monitoring\nWeb-based reporting of Internet usage to help employers and administrators spot problems, manage employee productivity and prevent liabilities.\n\nAny problems just tell! Read the .nfo file how install please\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f48b8d98bfe065deccf28bec1ce0b59307db42b3","amp;dn":"Kerio.WinRoute.v.6.7.0.6161.CRACKED.EXE-ViTYAN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f48b8d98bfe065deccf28bec1ce0b59307db42b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,139,141,152,191,224,101,222,204,242,139,236,28,224,181,147,7,219,66,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
