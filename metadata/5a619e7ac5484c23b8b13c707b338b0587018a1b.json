Now that I'm back, he was quick to remind me!  So, here it is, as promised.  For those who haven't seen this flick, it's worth a look.  The film is basically about a fairly happy guy who likes his life, his wife, and the way things are going ... right up until he gets unfortunately put between an alien race, their struggle to escape from Earth, and the governments of the world who want the aliens to teach them their technological and weapon advancements.\n\nThe film is semi-documentarial, like the TV Show 'The Office', yet is still filled with an interesting blend of mystery, action, and science fiction.  Of course, the film is set in the classic heart of racial tension -- Johanessburg, South Africa -- and the racial tension is no longer about skin color, but species.  All of this combines to make a fairly compelling and interesting film that is definitely worth a look.\n\nTRIVIA:\n1.  Part of the film's marketing campaign in the US and UK were posters hung up in major cities around bus stops and enterances to mass transit stations that designated the areas as 'humans-only' and gave a phone number to call in order to report non-humans.  The phone number led to an automated recording stating that all MNU operators were busy and to try calling back later.  The posters had NO film title on them, but the website address at the bottom led to the official District 9 website.\n2.  Supposedly, this film had been written by director Neil Blomkamp years ago, but when the feature film based on the 'Halo' video game series fell through (which Blomkamp was hired to direct), producer Peter Jackson (of Lord of the Rings fame) offered him $30 million to make whatever film he wanted.  Supposedly, this is the film that resulted from that.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nScreen Shots\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dis91.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dis91.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dis92.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dis92.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dis93.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dis93.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dis94.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dis94.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dis95.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dis95.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dis96.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dis96.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dis97.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dis97.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dis98.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/dis98.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdditional Info\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike all my iPod torrents, these files have their ID3 tags preformatted for your ease!
