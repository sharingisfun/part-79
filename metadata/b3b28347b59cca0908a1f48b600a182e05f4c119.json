The instrumental called &quot;Bag End&quot; really grew into its own during this run, an exotic, atmospheric musical journey to Middle Earth.  &quot;Come On In My Kitchen&quot; brought some down-home blues flavor in its only Palace appearance, and Boz Scaggs' &quot;Ain't No Love In The Heart Of The City&quot; was delivered with passion and authority by Gregg, who sounded great all night.  &quot;Into The Mystic&quot; and &quot;You Don't Love Me&quot; with guest Scott Sharrard on guitar finished off a great first set!\n\nAs good as the first set was, the massive &quot;Mountain Jam&quot; sandwich that comprised the majority of the second set was what people were buzzing about after the show.  After a great first half of &quot;Mountain Jam,&quot; Jay Collins of Gregg's solo band added some great sax licks to a bluesy, jazzy &quot;Desdemona&quot; that kept the momentum going strong.  Then came an expansive &quot;Black Hearted Woman&quot; with fiery vocals from Gregg, raw power from the rhythm section, and positively cosmic solos from Warren and Derek.  After the &quot;JaMaBuBu&quot; section the band returned to the &quot;Mountain Jam&quot; theme for a powerful concluding jam, wrapping up an amazing second set!\n\nAll this and a cataclysmic &quot;Whipping Post&quot; encore featuring Jay Collins on sax?  Yes please!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3b28347b59cca0908a1f48b600a182e05f4c119","amp;dn":"The+Allman+Brothers+-+LIVE+03%2F18%2F2010+%5B320k+MP3%5D+NYC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3b28347b59cca0908a1f48b600a182e05f4c119","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,178,131,71,181,156,202,9,8,161,244,139,96,10,24,46,5,244,193,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
