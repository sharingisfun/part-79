Upon receiving a letter from his one-time fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e, Willow (Kate Beahan), imploring him to search for her missing daughter on the secluded island of Summersisle, Policeman Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) quickly makes his way to the island to locate the girl and seek an answer as to why Willow suddenly and inexplicably disappeared shortly before their wedding date. Once there, Malus is troubled to discover that although there are traces of the child to be found in such locations as the local schoolhouse, the residents of Summersisle seem reluctant to offer any specific details as to the girl's apparent death. His investigation effectively stalled by the highly secretive Wiccan community, Sheriff Malus soon discovers that there are still some cultures that have their own unique beliefs about humankind's relationship with Mother Earth, and refuse to adapt to the rules of modern society. ~ Jason Buchanan, All Movie Guide\n\n\n\nTheatrical Feature Running Time: 102 mins \nComplete Cast:\nNicolas Cage - Edward Malus\nKate Beahan - Sister Willow\nMolly Parker - Sister Thorn\nDiane Delano - Sister Beech\nErika-Shaye Gair - Rowan\nEmily Holmes - Station Wagon Mom\nMatthew Walker - Sea Plane Pilot\nChristine Willes - Sister Violet\nDavid Purvis - Ivy\nTania Saulnier - Attendant #1\nMoraea Bieber - School Girl #1\nTalia Ranger - School Girl #3\nSimon Longmore - Village Male #1\nJacqueline Robbins - Blind Twin #1\nAaron Eckhart - Truck Stop Patron\nJason Ritter - Bar Guy #2\nEllen Burstyn - Sister Summerisle\nFrances Conroy - Dr. Moss\nLeelee Sobieski - Sister Honey\nMichael Wiseman - Pete\nChrista Campbell - Truck Stop Waitress\nZemphira Gosling - Station Wagon Girl\nMark Black - Sister Oak\nSophie Hough - Daisy\nXantha Radley - Village Sister #1\nAnna Van Hooft - Attendant #2\nJayda Bieber - School Girl #2\nKendall Cross - Female Cop\nAndre Danyliu - Village Male #2\nJoyce Robbins - Blind Twin #2\nJames Franco - Bar Guy #1\n\n\nDirector(s):Neil LaBute\nWriter(s):Anthony Shaffer, Neil LaBute\nProducer(s):Avi Lerner, Norm Golightly, Nicolas Cage\nTheatrical MPAA Rating: PG13(Not For Children, Profanity, Violence)\nCategories:Horror\n\nFormat: DVD\nRelease Date: 12/19/2006\nMPAA Rating: PG13\nRunning Time: 102 min\nNumber of Discs: 1\nLanguage: Eng\nSubTitles: Eng/Fre/Spa\nView special edition featuresView special edition featuresLimited Edition Features:\n2 editions of the movie - an unrated version (side A) with an alternate end sequence not shown theatrically, and the widescreen theatrical release version (side B)\nCommentary by writer/director Neil LaBute, co-stars Leelee Sobieski and Kate Beahan, editor Joel Plotch and costume designer Lynette Meyer \nTheatrical trailer\nSubtitles: English, FanÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ais, EspaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ol (feature film only)\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!\n\nThis is an EvilTSAngel Original DVDRip!\n\nOriginal Menu's and extra's included!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fff32c13229f909518a7320fcea1cd2f1777bc2","amp;dn":"The+Wicker+Man+-+2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fff32c13229f909518a7320fcea1cd2f1777bc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,255,50,193,50,41,249,9,81,138,115,32,252,234,28,210,241,119,123,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
