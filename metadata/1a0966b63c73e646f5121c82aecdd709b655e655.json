Click on my user name above to access the rest of these videos. These videos are an incredible collection of information that is incredibly hard to find on U.S. corporate controlled media! Please download these videos and share them through any means that you can! These videos may be used for any purpose, including commercial use. Just make sure lots of people watch them.\n\n\n################################################################\n\n\nIf for some reason you cannot get a seed for these torrents, there is a FAST server located here:\n\n66.90.104.17 port 6878\n\nIf you add that server, your download will go MUCH faster! The fast server listed above cannot make direct connections to TPB trackers because it is blocked somewhere. It crosses a Comcast network in order to reach TPB, so I am betting that is where the trouble is... but that is just a guess.\n\nThere are also web download options for all of these videos on the server listed above.

This video does a great job at exposing the U.S. propaganda about Venezuela and Latin America!\n\nThis is definitely must see material, especially if you live within the United States!!!\n\nFor example, please read this excellent article written Aug. 5 by the host of this panel:\n\n&quot;Venezuela: Socialism for the 21st Century&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/4690&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/4690&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAfter you see this video, I am sure that you will want to share it with everyone.\n\nThis is why I have released it under &quot;Kopimi&quot; rules. So, PLEASE copy and share as much as you can! Watchout! The Kopimi Gods are watching you not share this video!\n\n\n\nThis is a panel discussion with Eva Golinger and Evergreen State College professors and students discussing Venezuela, U.S. Intervention and Media Control. The video also includes MartÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­n SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡nchez, CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³nsul General of Venezuela.\n\n\nEva Golinger is a famous author and attorney. To find her books in a local library, search worldcat. Here is a convenient link to find her books: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3AEva+Golinger&amp;qt=hot_author&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3AEva+Golinger&amp;qt=hot_author&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nAs you may already know, the United States has a lot of ties to the coup in Honduras. Eva Golinger has written several excellent articles about this subject. Considering the extensive research that she has done concerning the United States role in the coup in Venezuela, I would pretty much consider her to be an expert in this area. I trust that what she has written about Honduras to be nothing but the truth.\n\n\nRead Eva's excellent article at this first link:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/Article_56331.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/Article_56331.shtml&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nRead more of Eva's articles here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/Golinger.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/Golinger.shtml&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nPlease see the related information here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org/features/honduras_coup&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org/features/honduras_coup&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nEva's Books:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3AEva+Golinger&amp;qt=hot_author&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3AEva+Golinger&amp;qt=hot_author&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nEva's blog:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.chavezcode.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.chavezcode.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to know what is REALLY going on in the world, these sites will tell you the truth!\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://democracynow.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://democracynow.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://commondreams.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://commondreams.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venezuelanalysis.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venezuelanalysis.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cispes.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cispes.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://upsidedownworld.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://upsidedownworld.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nacla.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nacla.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://narconews.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://narconews.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://diariocolatino.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://diariocolatino.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://aporrea.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://aporrea.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pcasc.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pcasc.net/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nAlso these are some good Arabic sites in English.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rawa.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rawa.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.voicesofpalestine.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.voicesofpalestine.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nPlease forgive my horrible description.
