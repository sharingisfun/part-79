However, it was then re-made for the cinema two years later and became one of the most infamous British films of the 1980s. Mark investigates the accuracy of the film and offers a portrait of its uncompromising director Alan Clarke.\n\nFeaturing new interviews, including screenwriter Roy Minton, actor Mick Ford, former director of BBC television Alasdair Milne and the producers of both the BBC and theatrical versions.\n\n\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration        : 28mn 1s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c14865c66fa31710b53b7d3f6abb39d22589012","amp;dn":"Scum++-+Who%5C%27s+the+Daddy%3F+++%28BBC+Audio%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c14865c66fa31710b53b7d3f6abb39d22589012","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,20,134,92,102,250,49,113,11,83,183,211,246,171,179,157,34,88,144,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
