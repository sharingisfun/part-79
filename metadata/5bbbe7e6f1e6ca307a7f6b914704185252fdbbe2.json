The music is 70s funk/rock all instrumental.\n\nSorry, I have no song titles. These tracks may or may not be included in the i76 official soundtrack http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4575414/Interstate_76_OST i'm not sure. These are strait rips from the cd.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nTaken from the wiki entry:\n\n&quot;The Interstate '76 soundtrack was composed by Arion Salazar who would later achieve fame as a founding member of Third Eye Blind. The music was performed under the name &quot;Bullmark&quot; with Salazar on bass, Santana-alumni Tom Coster on keyboards, and Bryan Mantia, who among his performing credits previously played with Primus and Guns N' Roses, on drums. Eric Valentine (who also mixed for Third Eye Blind at the time) mixed and engineered for the soundtrack. The soundtrack recreated the funk sound of '70s' film and television theme music. Some are sly variations of popular '70s' funk tracks, such as &quot;Never Get Outta The Car&quot;'s pastiche  of The Brothers Johnson's 1976 hit &quot;Get The Funk Out Ma Face&quot;. The soundtrack was recorded using vintage instruments and recording technology in order to as closely reproduce this sound as possible. Activision released a separate official soundtrack CD which contained all tracks from the game and unreleased tracks from the recording sessions. Versions of the background music tracks can also be found on the game play disc as redbook audio.&quot;\n-------------------------------------------------\nTracked and seeded by http://tracker.thehashden.com/announce","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bbbe7e6f1e6ca307a7f6b914704185252fdbbe2","amp;dn":"Music+from+the+i76+Nitro+Pack+1997","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bbbe7e6f1e6ca307a7f6b914704185252fdbbe2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,187,231,230,241,230,202,48,122,127,107,145,71,4,24,82,82,253,187,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
