Based on the virtual military simulator VBS1, the game features realistic warfare.\n\nI have used this old game to create a LARGE SCALE WARFARE campaign. Obviously the graphic is not the lastest and best. However, the low CPU requirement is not all bad because it enables huge, realistic battle scenarios.\n\nThus, this mission campaign features large scale warfare with HUNDREDS OF MEN, vehicle, and civilians. You're one the men fighting in this war of Malden. The missions will allow you to play as urban warfare, stealth action, chopper raids, blietzkrieg, &quot;Normandy&quot; beach landing, field battles, anti-air defense and civilian street race. \n\nThe battles are HUGE so you'll need a good computer in order to play these missions. I recommend 2,5 GHz CPU, but you can lower the recuirements by deleting some units.\n\nAlong with &quot;Large Scale Warfare&quot;, I've also added Operation Firelord to this torrent. Operation Firelord was done by Devilchaser and it is the most well done mission available to OFP - praised by many as the best mission ever. If you love realistic warfare you definially should download and play these missions, which really are one of a kind.\n\n\nNote: Operation Firelord does not work with the add ons! However, Large Scale Warfare works on any version, including with add on.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstallation Guide\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1) Extract the *.pbo mission files to *Missions .\n\n2) Extract the mission folders with its content to *Users[User name]missions .\n\n3) You can now edit the missions or simply play the game!\n\n\n\nLinks &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_flashpoint&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_flashpoint&lt;/a&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/search/operation%20flashpoint/0/99/0\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f73f96b16a6460af860d84c309f702d491b334a2","amp;dn":"Operation+Flashpoint+-+Greatest+Missions+-+Large+Scale+Warfare","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f73f96b16a6460af860d84c309f702d491b334a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,63,150,177,106,100,96,175,134,13,132,195,9,247,2,212,145,179,52,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
