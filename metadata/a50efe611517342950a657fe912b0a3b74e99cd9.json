So yea, first let me start by saying that you assholes aren't nice enough to just say thanks for the upload or appreciate your work.  Instead you go and bitch about me having a watermark on my video....or rather a logo. A fucking logo, whoopteedoo.  MTV DOES THAT SHIT TOO YOU GONNA SUE EM?  NOPE  Go suck a fucking dick seriously.  Its a video.  Want a better version?  GO GET IT YOUR DAMN SELF!!!!\n\nThis is the HQ release of Lady GaGa's VMA Performance of &quot;Paparazzi&quot;, ripped right from MTV's site :P haha.  Took me forever to get a quality screen capture. It's the Widescreen 16:9 version too, so should be better than the fullscreen rip's I've seen.  Enough about the techy crap, Her performance was amazing, probably my favorite from the VMA's.  The song is really good too, I believe somebody said she wrote the song to honor Princess Diana's death, possibly because of &quot;paparazzi&quot; that were following her the night of her death.\n\nI ripped this from MTV (hehehe) so the quality is slightly better than an HQ YT video. Codec for video is DivX @ 4019kbps Reso: 692x392 and codec for audio is MP3 @ 256kbps 48000khz.  I initially captured the video with no audio (stupid Vista stereo mix lol) but that was good because it uses more cpu to capture audio in the process, resulting in jittery video capture.  I then used VirtualDubMod to add the MP3 stream to the file of the audio from the MTV version, and save the AVI.  There was no extra processing involved other than the initial capture of the video.  Video file size is big because I captured it at 200fps to make sure it didn't miss any frames from the video.  It still somewhat does &quot;jerk&quot; and miss a frame here and there, but it isn't noticeable really.  Hope you enjoy the video.  If you like it, give me some +'s and comment it as well :)\n\nScreens &amp; Thumbnails &lt;a href=&quot; http://bayimg.com/oaEfKaACF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://bayimg.com/oaEfKaACF&lt;/a&gt;  Honestly, the video looks better than this shows.  Its worth the bit 136mb file :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a50efe611517342950a657fe912b0a3b74e99cd9","amp;dn":"Lady+GaGa+-+Paparazzi+%5BVMA+2009%5D+%5BHQ%5D+%5Bballeron24z%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a50efe611517342950a657fe912b0a3b74e99cd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,14,254,97,21,23,52,41,80,166,87,254,145,43,10,59,116,233,156,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
