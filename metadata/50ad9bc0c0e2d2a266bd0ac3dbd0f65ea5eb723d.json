For example, the glammy disco thump of the opening &quot;Adolescent Sex&quot; has more to do with the Sweet than Brian Eno, and the version of Smokey Robinson &amp; the Miracles' &quot;I Second That Emotion&quot; taken from a 1980 single sounds more like a failed attempt at chart success than an artistic experiment. Furthermore, David Sylvian's voice is completely different on the early tracks here, a nasal whine that's difficult to listen to for more than a few minutes at a time. That said, there are a few not-bad tracks here. &quot;Communist China&quot; is intriguing post-punk that hints at the loud-soft dynamic of Gentlemen Take Polaroids, and &quot;Rhodesia,&quot; a not entirely successful reggae experiment, at least introduces the use of world music forms, atmospheric production, and smoother, more controlled singing that would characterize their later career. That later career starts on side two, where, after the electro-disco sidetrack of the Giorgio Moroder collaboration &quot;Life in Tokyo,&quot; Japan's sudden left turn into artsy soft rock begins with the original &quot;European Son&quot; and an imaginative reworking of the Velvet Underground's &quot;All Tomorrow's Parties.&quot; Assemblage isn't entirely essential, but with its singles and previously unreleased tracks, it's a better starting point than either of Japan's first two albums.&quot; \n\nNote to Sony-BMG Music Entertainment (UK/Europe): the next time you release another repackaged/expanded/copy-protected and supposedly 'digitally remastered' version of this album, or any other Japan compilation a) could you do us all a favour and master all titles from the actual master tapes - including the bonus tracks - as opposed to from vinyl or in some cases very obviously cassettes? b) could you then do us all a favour and use some sort of tape-hiss noise reduction? c) could you do us all a favour and make sure that there are no sound drop outs on any of the tracks? d) could you do us all a favour and make sure that all tracks really are in proper stereo as opposed to one side of the two-track mix spread across both channels? e) could you do us all a favour and make sure that you don't accidentally delete the opening bar to any of the tracks? f) could you do us all a favour and make sure that you don't accidentally delete parts of the vocals on one of the tracks? f) could you do us all a favour and make sure that you don't accidentally delete the drums/bass/guitars/synths etc. on any of the other tracks? g) could you do us all a favour and make sure that you don't 'accidentally' include the album version of a track twice and then label one of them as &quot;12&quot; Mix&quot;, &quot;Extended Version&quot;, &quot;New Edit&quot; or &quot;Remix&quot;? h) could you do us all a favour and make sure that the tracks, versions and mixes listed on the album cover also are those on the actual disc?
