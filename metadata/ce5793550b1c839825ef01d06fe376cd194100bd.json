Howard reads a list of all of each thing and KC hilariously explains why each one went wrong.  Nothing ever seems to work for him.  The best part is the KC songs by Richard &amp; Sal.  Good stuff.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce5793550b1c839825ef01d06fe376cd194100bd","amp;dn":"Howard+Stern+-+HTVOD+-+KC%5C%27s+Failed+Ventures+08-13-2009%28wush%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce5793550b1c839825ef01d06fe376cd194100bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,87,147,85,11,28,131,152,37,239,1,208,111,227,118,205,25,65,0,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
