The story scenario in which locals, then passers-by and finally distant tourists gravitate to and then make a festival or circus out of the event (the film was also released under the title &quot;The Big Carnival&quot;) is supported by the real events on which the story was most likely based: the West VA mine disaster in 1925 that trapped miner Floyd Collins and was reported for 17 days, much as in the film, by local newspaperman Skeets Miller, who crawled into the mineshaft for face-to-face interviews with the trapped and doomed Collins.\n\nThis movie fits nicely into the Film Noir genre, although it takes place largely under the hot, harsh glare of the Arizona sun, highlighting the sweat and grime visible on the characters' skin and creating a visual metaphor for the sorry state of their souls. I wonder if Henri-Georges Clouzot saw this film before he began filming &quot;The Wages of Fear,&quot; because the visually pervasive atmosphere of sweat and filth and opportunism are equally present in both. \n\nVideo\nmped-4\nw/h 576x432\nbitrate 750 kbps\nframe 23.976\nAudio\nmpeg4aac\nsample 44100\nbitrate 128 kbps\nchannel 2\nduration 01:51:15\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8230c21a58260ec75957370df24a78e6ab6b0be5","amp;dn":"Ace+in+the+Hole+%28Kirk+Douglas%29+%5B1951%5D%40.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8230c21a58260ec75957370df24a78e6ab6b0be5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,48,194,26,88,38,14,199,89,87,55,13,242,74,120,230,171,107,11,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
