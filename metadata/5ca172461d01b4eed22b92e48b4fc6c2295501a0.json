(2008) UK DVDR\n\nIMDB - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1130088/\n\nSet in 1980s seaside England, this is the story of Edward, an unusual ten year old boy growing up in an old people's home run by his parents. Whilst his mother struggles to keep the family business afloat, and his father copes with the onset of mid-life crisis, Edward is busy tape-recording the elderly residents to try and discover what happens when they die. Increasingly obsessed with ghosts and the afterlife, Edward's is a rather lonely existence until he meets Clarence, the latest recruit to the home, a retired magician with a liberating streak of anarchy. Is There Anybody There? tells the surprising, touching story of this odd couple - a boy and an old man - facing life together, with Edward learning to live in the moment and Clarence coming to terms with the past.\n\nDVD includes trailer, interviews with Michael Caine, Bill Milner, Anne-Marie Duff and the director John Crowley, director's audio commentary during the movie.\n\nSize: 4.36 Gb ( 4Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â 571Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â 114 KBytes ) - DVD-5\nEnabled regions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\nPlay Length: 01:30:40\nVideo: PAL 16:9 (720x576) VBR, Auto Letterboxed\nAudio: English (Dolby AC3, 6 ch), English (Dolby AC3, 2 ch), English (Dolby AC3, 2 ch)\nSubtitles: English\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ca172461d01b4eed22b92e48b4fc6c2295501a0","amp;dn":"Is+Anybody+There%3F+%282008%29+UK+DVDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ca172461d01b4eed22b92e48b4fc6c2295501a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,161,114,70,29,1,180,238,210,43,146,228,139,79,198,194,41,85,1,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
