However, I found the length of the video for the first episode is shorter than the subtitle file by about two minutes. This means the video has been edited--shortened. The amount removed does not affect the story significantly, and I did not investigate further.\n\n2) Most of the movie appeared dark--too dark. I lightened it slightly.\n\n\n\nOnce again I have had to resort to peculiar name changes in order to get around\n\nPirate Bay's censors.  They would not allow me to use the straightforward name\n\nin a civilized way: &quot;Aleady this torrent is in the system,&quot; they said. Poor chaps.\n \nThey don't realize I'm arranging things better for the viewer.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:455d9c008c83b5cdc1bce3e8bbd997b380526dbd","amp;dn":"Bleak+House+2+update+%282005%29+BBC+TV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"455d9c008c83b5cdc1bce3e8bbd997b380526dbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,93,156,0,140,131,181,205,193,188,227,232,187,217,151,179,128,82,109,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
