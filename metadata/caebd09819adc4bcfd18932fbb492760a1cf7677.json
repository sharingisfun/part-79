It was more commonly known among English-speakers as the Russian version of &quot;Show Me Love&quot;.\n\nI sped up &quot;Ya Tvoya&quot; by about 5% but left the pitch the same, as it was already in the same key. Created in Adobe Premiere Pro (It was a pain in the butt to work with!)\n\nIt's pretty dramatic, kind of a dark but high-energy piece. Hope you enjoy it. Feel free to drop by the forum at http://www.dzxproductions.com for Anime Music Videos, other music mixes, or just to have fun and hang out. I'd love to hear if you enjoyed this mix. :3\n\n-ZaCloud\nDZX Productions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caebd09819adc4bcfd18932fbb492760a1cf7677","amp;dn":"DZX+Mashup+-+Serj+Tankian+vs+tATu+-+Love+is+Over","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caebd09819adc4bcfd18932fbb492760a1cf7677","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,235,208,152,25,173,196,188,253,24,147,47,187,73,39,96,161,207,118,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
