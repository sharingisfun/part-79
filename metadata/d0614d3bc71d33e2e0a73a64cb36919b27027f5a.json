A follow up hit came in November, 1976 with &quot;Too Hot To Touch&quot;, which reached number 19, from their self-titled album Supernaut.\n\nIn 1978 Supernaut relocated to Sydney and shortened their name, their hair and changed their attitude. They opted for punk/new wave garage style and became &quot;The Nauts&quot;. They released an album (produced by Robie Porter) under that name in 1978. The album was widely acclaimed by critics but sales weren't forthcoming and they disbanded in 1980.\n\n\n\n\nClassic,awesome and rare","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0614d3bc71d33e2e0a73a64cb36919b27027f5a","amp;dn":"Supernaut+-+Too+Hot+To+Touch+%5BCountdown+1976%5D.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0614d3bc71d33e2e0a73a64cb36919b27027f5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,97,77,59,199,29,51,226,224,167,58,100,203,54,145,155,39,2,127,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
