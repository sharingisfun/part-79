This is the reason for the bombings.  Islam is also a Satanist religion unless its followers recognise Allah as the creator and father of Jesus, that way they claim their true heritage and can then recognise Jesus as the next step to salvation.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe BBC's Conspiracy Files attempts to investigates a range of remarkable claims that have been made after the bomb attacks on London's transport system four years ago. Why did the government claim the bombers had travelled to London on a train that didn't run on that day? Did Israeli security forces know of the attacks in advance like they did on 9/11, and then warn their officials visiting London not go near the targeted locations? These are just some of the remarkable claims being made.\n\nOn the morning of 7th July, 2005 four bombs exploded in different parts of the London transport network. One tore a bus a part, three others hit vital sections of the underground train system. 52 people were killed and more than 700 injured.\n\nPolice quickly established the bombs had been carried and detonated by four British Muslims acting as suicide bombers. It appeared to be an open and shut case if you didn't look into the secret happenings of the attacks. But in the wake of the bombings conspiracy theories began to flourish and properly expose the tyranny.\n\nIn part those theories were helped along when the first government inquiry into the bombings made a major error of fact. The report claimed the four men had travelled from Luton to central London on the 7.40 morning train. Further analysis revealed the 7.40 had been cancelled that day. This was a green light for a number of people to attack the government's version of events.\n\nWith the help of the internet unidentified individuals began accusing the British government of a cover up. Refusing to accept the idea that Muslims had detonated the bombs they accused intelligence agencies of masterminding a plot that would create a backlash against the Muslim community in Britain and justify the war in Iraq.\n\nOne particular video stood out. It was called, &quot;7/7- The Ripple Effect&quot;. Voiced by a man calling himself Muad Dib, it asked many questions. Did Israel warn its officials in London in advance of the blasts? Why was a van from a company with expertise in controlled demolition parked next to the London bus that was bombed? And who was the man workshopping an attack on the tube network on the day of the explosions?\n\nUnderstandably these questions and allegations have created tremendous divisions within the British public due to the learning that there are Zionist underplay in our societies. It's now estimated that up to one in four Muslims in Britain believes that the MI-5 or the government was involved in the bombings. At the same time one observer of the attack is outraged at what they believe are ridiculous accusations.  Is this observer a setup.\n\nIn attempt to assess the truth behind the conspiracy theories the BBC program looks at a few accusation. It then tracks down the individuals at the centre of those claims. It takes us through their background, it looks at what is being said about them and then asks them to explain what they were doing on that fateful day.\n\nAt the same time the program confronts the people who are behind the claims. It looks at their background and their motivations and delivers some shocking revelations that are used to character assassinate their position.  Like one man denies the six million Jewish deaths, even though the six million figure has been officially revised anyway. Another who thinks he's a messenger of god. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/conspiracy_files/8107594.stm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/conspiracy_files/8107594.stm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n  ____                      _                      _   _       _\n / ___|___  _ __  ___ _ __ (_)_ __ __ _  ___ _   _| | | |_   _| |__\n| |   / _ \\| '_ \\/ __| '_ \\| | '__/ _` |/ __| | | | |_| | | | | '_ \\\n| |__| (_) | | | \\__ \\ |_) | | | | (_| | (__| |_| |  _  | |_| | |_) |\n \\____\\___/|_| |_|___/ .__/|_|_|  \\__,_|\\___|\\__, |_| |_|\\__,_|_.__/\n                     |_|                     |___/\n   ____\n  / ___|___  _ __ ___\n | |   / _ \\| '_ ` _ \\\n | |__| (_) | | | | | |\n(_)____\\___/|_| |_| |_|\n\n\nPLEASE KEEP SEEDED.
