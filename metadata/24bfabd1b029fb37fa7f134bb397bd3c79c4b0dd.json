If you want to do an upgrade install extract then run setup.exe.  If you aren't able to do an upgrade install then extract then open Sources&gt;cversion.ini and change both to your build number (Vista SP1 = 6001)\n\nThe activator that is included has instructions on usage that i simplified for what worked for me.\n\nFor those of you who are skeptical about releases of Windows 7, i included the Windows 7 ISO Verifier for you. :)\n\nRecommended Program for burning to a DVD is ImgBurn - http://www.imgburn.com/\nFor best use burn at x4 speed.\n\n-Edit-\nOMG i didnt know this would be downloaded so many times.  Thanx to all who seeded or are still seeding.  You ppl help me bring more awesome torrents like this.\n-/edit-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24bfabd1b029fb37fa7f134bb397bd3c79c4b0dd","amp;dn":"Windows+7+RTM+x32%2Bx64+with+Activator","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24bfabd1b029fb37fa7f134bb397bd3c79c4b0dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,191,171,209,176,41,251,55,250,127,19,75,179,151,189,60,121,196,176,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
