One involves Mafia chief Michael Corleone following the events of the first film from 1958 to 1959; the other is a series of flashbacks following his father, Vito Corleone, from his childhood in Sicily (1901) to his founding of the criminal Corleone Family in New York City while still a young man (1917ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1925).\n\nIn 1901, in the town of Corleone in Sicily, at the funeral procession for young Vito's father, Antonio Andolini, who had been ordered killed by the local Mafia chieftain, Don Ciccio. During the procession, Vito's older brother Paolo is also murdered because he swore revenge on the Don. Vito's mother goes to Ciccio to beg him to let young Vito live. When he refuses, she holds a knife to his throat, sacrificing herself to allow Vito to escape, and Ciccio's gunmen shoot her. They scour the town for Vito, warning the sleeping townsfolk that they will regret harboring the boy. With the aid of a few of the townspeople, Vito finds his way by ship to New York. Arriving at Ellis Island, an immigration agent, mishearing Vito's hometown of Corleone as his surname, registers him as &quot;Vito Corleone&quot;. He is then ordered to stay on the island for several months due to smallpox.\n\nIn 1958, Michael Corleone, Godfather of the Corleone Family, deals with various business and family problems at his Lake Tahoe, Nevada compound during an elaborate party celebrating his son's First Communion. He meets with Nevada Senator Pat Geary (G.D Spradlin), who despises the Corleones, but has shown up with his wife to accept a large endowment to the state university. Senator Geary demands a grossly exaggerated price for a new gaming license and a monthly payment of 5% of the gross profits from all of the Corleone Family's Nevada gaming interests, all while insulting the Corleones and Italians in general. Michael defends his family while keeping his usual calm demeanor, and tells Senator Geary that his offer is for Geary to give him the gaming license for free.\n\nMichael also deals with his sister Connie, who, although recently divorced, is planning to marry a man with no obvious means of support, and of whom Michael disapproves. He also talks with Johnny Ola, the right hand man of Jewish gangster Hyman Roth, who is supporting Michael's move into the gambling industry. Finally, Michael meets with Frank Pentangeli, who took over Corleone caporegime Pete Clemenza's territory after his death, and now has problems with the Rosato Brothers, who are backed by Roth. Michael refuses to allow Pentangeli to kill the Rosatos, due to his desire to prevent interruption of his business with Roth. Pentangeli leaves abruptly, after telling Michael &quot;your father did business with Hyman Roth, your father respected Hyman Roth, but your father never trusted Hyman Roth or his Sicilian messenger boy Johnny Ola.&quot;\n\nLater that night, an assassination attempt is made on Michael, which he survives when his wife Kay notices that the bedroom window drapes are inexplicably open. Afterward, Michael tells Tom Hagen that the hit was made with the help of someone close, and that the gunmen, whoever they were, are probably already dead. Michael then insists that he must leave and entrusts Hagen to protect his family. The Corleone guards then search the compound, and as Michael suspected, the gunmen are found dead.\n\nIn 1917, the 25-year-old Vito Corleone, now married with one son, works in a New York grocery store with his close friend Genco Abbandando. The neighborhood is controlled by a blackhander, Don Fanucci, who extorts protection payments from local businesses. One night, Vito's neighbor Clemenza asks him to hide a stash of guns for him, and later, to repay the favor, takes him to a fancy apartment where they commit their first crime together, stealing an expensive rug.\n\nMichael's brother Fredo (John Cazale) receives a phone call from Johnny Ola in the middle of the night while sleeping. The conversation that takes place makes it clear that it was Fredo who gave Roth's men entry into the compound and then shot them, though Fredo was apparently unaware they would try to kill Michael.\n\nMichael (accompanied by a silent bodyguard) meets with Hyman Roth in his home near Miami and tells him that he believes Frank Pentangeli was responsible for the assassination attempt and that Pentangeli will pay for it. Traveling to Brooklyn, Michael lets Pentangeli know that Roth was actually behind it and that Michael has a plan to deal with Roth, but needs Frankie to cooperate with the Rosato Brothers in order to put Roth off guard. When Pentangeli goes to meet with the Rosatos, he is told &quot;Michael Corleone says hello,&quot; as he is garroted; but the attempted murder is accidentally interrupted by a policeman. Pentangeli is left for dead, and his bodyguard, Willi Cicci, is wounded by gunfire. It is later revealed that Roth orchestrated the whole thing: ordering the hit on Pantangeli and sending the policeman to interrupt it.\n\nIn Nevada, Tom Hagen is called to a brothel run by Fredo, where a dazed Senator Geary is implicated in the death of a prostitute. Tom offers to take care of the problem in return for &quot;friendship&quot; between the Senator and the Corleone Family. It has been suggested that the entire event was staged by the Corleone Family in order to gain leverage with Geary and force his cooperation.\n\nMeanwhile, Michael meets Roth in Havana, Cuba at the time when dictator Fulgencio Batista is soliciting American investment, and guerrillas are trying to bring down the government. At a birthday party for Roth, Michael ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ having earlier witnessed a rebel deliberately killing himself and an army officer with a hand grenade ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ mentions that there is a possibility that the rebels might win, making their business dealings in Cuba problematic. The comment prompts Roth to remark, privately, that Michael shouldn't talk about such things in mixed company. Roth is also upset that Michael has not delivered the two million dollars to seal their partnership. He turns the conversation to a positive note, saying that Cuba is much better for business than the United States, where they were persecuted by Estes Kefauver and his aspirations to be president. He says that they have the kind of money to make someone else president (a reference to rumors that John F. Kennedy had ties to the mafia), and that they are &quot;bigger than U.S. Steel.&quot;\n\nFredo, carrying the promised money, arrives in Havana and meets Michael. Michael mentions Hyman Roth and Johnny Ola to him, but Fredo says he has never met them. Michael confides to his brother that it was Roth who tried to kill him, and that he plans to try again. Michael assures Fredo that he has already made his move, and that &quot;Hyman Roth will never see the New Year.&quot;\n\nInstead of turning over the money, Michael asks Roth who gave the order to have Frank Pentangeli killed. (At this time, he believes that Pentangeli is dead.) Roth avoids the question, instead speaking angrily of the murder of his old friend and ally Moe Greene, which Michael had orchestrated (as depicted at the end of the first film), saying, &quot;I didn't ask who gave the order, because it had nothing to do with business!&quot;. Hyman concludes by going to take a nap, and telling Michael to invest his $2 million, or they will not be business partners.\n\nMichael asks Fredo, who knows Havana well, to show Senator Geary and other important American officials and businessmen (many of them also senators) a good time, during which Fredo pretends to not know Johnny Ola. Later in the evening though, at a sex show, a drunk Fredo comments loudly that he learned about the place from Johnny Ola, contradicting what he told Michael twice earlier, that he didn't know Roth or Ola. Michael now realizes that the traitor in the Corleone Family is his own brother, and dispatches his bodyguard back to their hotel to kill Roth. There, Johnny Ola is strangled, but Roth, whose health is failing, is taken to a hospital before he can be assassinated. Michael's bodyguard follows, but is shot by police while trying to smother Roth with a pillow. It is left open to interpretation how the police become aware of the assassination attempt.\n\nAt Batista's New Year's Eve party, at the stroke of midnight, Michael grasps Fredo tightly by the head and kisses (Kiss of Death) him, telling him &quot;I know it was you Fredo; you broke my heart.&quot; Batista announces he is stepping down due to unexpected gains by the rebels. The guests flee as the guerrillas pour into the city. Fredo runs away from Michael, despite Michael's pleas that he is still his brother and that the only way out is with him. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071562/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071562/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPLEASE SEED AND ENJOY THANKS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7ff3233e6bae1a3a5bdf2080927b42d7e81fd38","amp;dn":"THE-GODFATHER.Part.2.DVDrip%5Bvice%5D...DISC.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7ff3233e6bae1a3a5bdf2080927b42d7e81fd38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,255,50,51,230,186,225,163,165,189,242,8,9,39,180,45,126,129,253,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
