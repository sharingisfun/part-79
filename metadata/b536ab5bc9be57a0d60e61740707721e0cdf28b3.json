They say it conveys the ennui of growing up in the back of beyond, and the searing pain of first love. Fair enough. I remember the hot naked Swedish totty. But hey, different strokes, etc.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274237/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274237/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDirected by Colin Nutley.\n\nNutley went to Portsmouth Art College and began his career in British television as a graphic designer. He then turned to drama and documentary film-making for ITV, BBC and Channel 4. He directed the first two episodes of children's television series Press Gang, but was unhappy with the final edit so asked for his name to be removed from the credits.[1] He was, however, the driving force behind Southern Television's ITV-networked children's series The Flockton Flyer, taking personal responsibility for much of the casting, and acting as Producer of the first series (filmed 1976, broadcast 1977) and Producer/Director of the second series (filmed 1977, broadcast 1978).\n\nNutley's work in Sweden began with the making of Annika, a TV-series about a Swedish girl who spent three weeks on the Isle of Wight as a language student in England. \n\n        Kjell Bergqvist as.
