Hud (T. J. Miller) is entrusted with the responsibility of videotaping the party--and as the trouble grows, he holds on to the camera, recording everything that happens. In fact, the entire movie is seen through the lens of his camera, reminiscent of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. As terrified people in a post-9/11 New York City take to the streets, Rob decides to head uptown to try to save Beth , the woman he loves, though he's afraid to tell her so. Rob is joined by his brother Jason, Jason's girlfriend Lily , Lily's friend Marlena , and Hud, who has a thing for Marlena. Rob is determined not to give up, even after almost being crushed by the Statue of Liberty's head and as the military shows up to force evacuation of the city. Very little else is explained, since the story is told completely through the video camera. And there is no additional score to heighten the drama; the only music is that which is picked up by Hud and the camera's microphone, including snippets of songs by Kings of Leon, Parliament Funkadelic, Of Montreal, and others. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a04b0a3fcf415a4ed4c920a624375e5901ee802","amp;dn":"Cloverfield+2008+BRRip+720p+H264+5.1-SToNe+P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a04b0a3fcf415a4ed4c920a624375e5901ee802","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,4,176,163,252,244,21,164,237,76,146,10,98,67,117,229,144,30,232,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
