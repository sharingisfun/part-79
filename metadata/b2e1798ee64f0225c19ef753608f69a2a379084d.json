I don't think that this is necessarily fair. It is not the most sophisticated navigation app available for the iphone but it does have some features the others seem to lack. For example full pinch, drag and rotate support in the main map area.  Also I have tried tomtom, igo, sygic, and navigon 1.2 and so far ndrive is the only one with the new Geelong bypass.\n\nApologies, original torrent experienced upload problems, all should be OK now","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2e1798ee64f0225c19ef753608f69a2a379084d","amp;dn":"ndrive+australia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2e1798ee64f0225c19ef753608f69a2a379084d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,225,121,142,230,79,2,37,193,158,247,83,96,143,105,162,163,121,8,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
