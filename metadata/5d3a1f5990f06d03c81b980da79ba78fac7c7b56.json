The series also uses action replays and computer animations, allowing it to analyze the tactics of predator and prey from every angle. It shows that both are often evenly matched, with no room on either side for the slightest mistake.\n\n\n\n\nProduced by: David Wallace\n--------------------------\n\n\n\n\nEPISODES:\n---------\n\nEpisode I - The ultimate predators\nEpisode II - Nowhere to hide\nEpisode III - Special agents\nEpisode IV - The skills to survive\nEpisode V - Mass attack\nEpisode VI- Natural born killers \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle: Predators-Special Agents(Episode III)\nYear:  2000\nFile Size: 349 MB \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:28:59\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVIdeo Bitrate:  1686 kbit/s\nFPS:  25.000000\nAudio Bitrate: 192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: (AC3)\nChannels:  2 \nSubtitles: (N/A)\nPart: Episode III of VI  \n \n\n\n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at   \n\nthis link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\nTips:For better background view chance the &quot;Style Chooser&quot; at the bottom left \ncorner to &quot;graphite_x&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d3a1f5990f06d03c81b980da79ba78fac7c7b56","amp;dn":"Predators-Episode+III-Special+Agents-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d3a1f5990f06d03c81b980da79ba78fac7c7b56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,58,31,89,144,240,109,3,200,27,152,13,167,155,167,143,172,124,123,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
