The sequel takes place primarily at the Lava Springs Country Club, an exclusive summer resort that hires Wildcat basketball hero Troy Bolton (Zac Efron), his genius girlfriend Gabriella Montez ({Vanessa Hudgens}), and their two best friends. The parents of scheming Sharpay Evans (Ashley Tisdale) own the resort, and she wields her remarkable power in an attempt to win Troy away from Gabriella. Eventually Troy must decide between a bright future with a scholarship, or true love. High School Musical 2 premiered on the cable outlook on August 17, 2007.\n\n\nM P A A  R A T I N G  * * *\n\nRated G\n\n\nR E L E A S E   D A T E  * * *\n\n17 August 2007\n\n\nD V D  C o n t e n t  * * *\n  \nMain Movie ******:\n* Video - UNTOUCHED - 2466 Kbps Fullscreen\n* Audio - English, Spanish, French\n* Subs  - English, Spanish, French\n\nMenu ************:\n* Yes\n\nExtras **********:\n* All\n\nRipped **********:\n* Nothing\n\nChapters ********:\n\n1.
