Gary Davis. \nEach weekend and school holiday I would take two trains from my home in Brooklyn up to Park Avenue in the Bronx. Rev. DavisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s home was hidden behind a worn out tenement building, down a flight of stairs where the garbage cans were kept and then up another small flight of stairs to a single dwelling that was surrounded on all four sides by apartment buildings.\n\nTo say it was 'different' would be to understate the effect it had on me. But once the screen door was opened and the scent of White Owl cigars hit my nose I knew I was at home. The warmth, generosity and education that I found in this 'country shack' in the midst of the great New York City has lasted me a lifetime.\n\nThis set of three CDs captures Rev. Davis at home and church - teaching, talking and philosophizing. The first two CDs are material recorded at his Bronx home. Religious songs, folk tunes, blues, rags and memories are included. The music ranges from the heavenly to the bawdy. The third CD features a service I recorded where Rev. Davis plays and delivers sermons. ~ Stefan GrossmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\nDisc 1(At Home)\n01.
