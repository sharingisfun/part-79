Enjoy the tornadoes.\n\nTwister is a 1996 American disaster film starring Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton as &quot;storm chasers&quot; researching tornadoes. It was directed by Jan de Bont. The film was based upon a script by Michael Crichton and Anne-Marie Martin. Twister was the second-highest grossing film of 1996, with an estimated 55 million tickets sold.\n\nIn the movie, a team of storm chasers try to perfect a data-gathering instrument, designed to be released into the funnel of a tornado, while competing with another better-funded team with a similar device during a tornado outbreak across Oklahoma.\n\nTwister is notable for being both the first Hollywood feature film to be released on the DVD format[1] and the last to be released on HD DVD.[2] Twister has since been released in high definition on Blu-ray disc. It was nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound in 1997.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c2cb85ffc7a070865b213a37373cc1c509dd199","amp;dn":"Twister+for+PSP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c2cb85ffc7a070865b213a37373cc1c509dd199","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,44,184,95,252,122,7,8,101,178,19,163,115,115,204,28,80,157,209,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
