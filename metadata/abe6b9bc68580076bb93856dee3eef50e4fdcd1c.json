What a marvelous and enjoyable experience it is to see the power of the Earth's physical properties. I will confess that I enjoyed the narrator's accent (much like my Mother's, though she insisted she had no accent)and his enthusiasm. Certainly it lends a different flavour when compared to David Attenborough's more mature tones. The use of extraordinarily clear computer graphics are startling. I found the size of the sphere made of all the water on Earth compared to the dry globe one of the most frightening sights ever. There is very little water by volume while I note that my conditioning was based on globes and maps showing area covered by water. Quite startling. I highly recommend this series.\n\nComments by some bloke on IMDB, but I must agree. Its wicked!\nAll my own DVD rips.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abe6b9bc68580076bb93856dee3eef50e4fdcd1c","amp;dn":"Earth+-+The+Power+Of+The+Planet+%28physixmaster%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abe6b9bc68580076bb93856dee3eef50e4fdcd1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,230,185,188,104,88,0,118,187,147,133,109,238,62,239,80,228,253,205,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
