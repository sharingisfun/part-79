The band formed in Seattle, USA, in 1993. The three-piece group currently comprises vocalist and &quot;basitarist&quot; Chris Ballew, drummer and vocalist Jason Finn with &quot;guitbassist&quot; and vocalist Andrew McKeag. Long time &quot;guitbassist&quot; and vocalist Dave Dederer departed the band in 2004, after 11 years. They have released six studio albums since forming in 1993.\n\n\n\nEarly years and rise to fame (1993ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1998)\nThe band was formed in late 1993 by Chris Ballew (basitar and lead vocals) and Dave Dederer (guitbass and backup vocals), who met while attending The Bush School in Seattle. Initially a drummerless duo, Ballew and Dederer performed a half-dozen or so shows in 1993 as &quot;The Lo-Fis&quot;, &quot;The Dynamic Duo&quot;, and &quot;Pure Frosting.&quot; Ballew eventually came upon the name &quot;The Presidents of the United States of America.&quot; Shortly after settling on their name, Ballew and Dederer added drummer Jason Finn; the band played their first show as a trio at Seattle's Romper Room in early December 1993. At the time, Finn was also the drummer in the band Love Battery, who had recently changed record labels from Sub Pop to Atlas Records, an A&amp;M subsidiary.\n\nThe Presidents recorded a 10-song cassette, Froggystyle, in early 1994 in one day at Laundry Room Studios. The band sold the cassette at shows in 1994. Finn also sold the cassette from behind the bar of Seattle's legendary Comet Tavern, where he bartended.\n\nIn 1994, the Presidents signed with the tiny Seattle label PopLlama Records and released their self-titled debut in the following year. The band also released a limited edition blue vinyl 7&quot; single, &quot;Fuck California&quot;, on C/Z Records. Columbia Records signed the band shortly thereafter and re-released the album in late July 1995. Driven by the singles &quot;Lump,&quot; &quot;Peaches,&quot; and &quot;Kitty,&quot; their debut album proved to be a smash.\n\nCritics praised PUSA's catchy, humorous, and self-deprecating songs, which were a major departure from the grunge/post-grunge sound. The album received Grammy nominations in 1996 and 1997. Though &quot;Peaches&quot; met the most critical success, the band credits &quot;Lump&quot; as their favorite single. The song's strange lyrics came from a dream that Ballew had while fighting pneumonia. The antibiotics he was taking caused an allergic reaction that produced several consecutive nights of wild and crazy dreams. The lyrics for &quot;Peaches&quot; were written about a crush Ballew used to have on a girl. According to him, she had a peach tree in the front of her yard, and when he finally summoned the courage to go talk to her, he stood under the tree and smashed peaches in his fist until he decided not to talk to her.\n\nIn 1996, &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic created a parody of the Presidents' &quot;Lump&quot;, titled &quot;Gump&quot;. This song was released on Yankovic's album Bad Hair Day.\n\nA follow-up album, II, received similar praise, but did not match the explosive commercial success that the Presidents' debut album had, though it was still certified &quot;Gold&quot; in the US.\n\nThroughout 1995, 1996 and 1997, the band made worldwide tours to support their first two albums. In addition to relentless touring in the U.S. and Canada, PUSA made multiple tours of Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. They also made many appearances in major print media and on radio and TV, including multiple appearances on Leno and Letterman in the U.S. A little-known fact is that the Presidents turned down an offer to perform on Saturday Night Live in the fall of 1995 because the date conflicted with Ballew's wedding.[2]\n\nPUSA broke up in January 1998 as Ballew quit to spend more time with his young family and explore other musical terrain. Pure Frosting, a final album composed of new songs, covers, and demos, was released in 1998. The CD also contained videos for &quot;Lump,&quot; &quot;Peaches,&quot; &quot;Mach 5,&quot; and &quot;Dune Buggy.&quot;\n\nPure Frosting featured two songs that had previously been used in a movie and as a television show theme. &quot;VIDEO KILLED THE RADIO STAR&quot; was included on the soundtrack for The Wedding Singer, while &quot;Cleveland Rocks&quot; was chosen as the theme song for The Drew Carey Show. Another song on the album, &quot;Man (Opposable Thumb)&quot;, appeared in the Nickelodeon-produced motion picture Good Burger but was not directly written or performed for the film.\n\nPUSA also wrote the theme song for the 1998 TV movie My Date with the President's Daughter. They also performed a cover of the George of the Jungle theme song for the 1997 movie of the same name. This performance is not available on any of their albums.\n\nIn 1996, the band performed a live concert at Mount Rushmore on Presidents Day. They were introduced with: &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, the Presidents of the United States.&quot;\n\n\nEnjoy classic from 1998","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbad19bab88de790feecc0377a432b2448eeceee","amp;dn":"Presidents+Of+The+USA+-+Video+Killed+The+Radio+Star.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbad19bab88de790feecc0377a432b2448eeceee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,173,25,186,184,141,231,144,254,236,192,55,122,67,43,36,72,238,206,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
