It was released by Tri-Star Pictures on August 14, 1987. The film features the classic monsters led by Dracula \n\nThe Monster Squad is a society of young pre-teens who idolize classic monsters and monster movies. In addition to a clubhouse in a tree, they actually have their own business cards. Club leader Sean (Andre Gower), whose five-year-old sister Phoebe (Ashley Bank) desperately wants to join the club, is given the diary of legendary vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing (Jack Gwillim) - but his excitement is somewhat toned down when he finds it's written in German. Sean, his best friend Patrick (Robby Kiger), and the rest of the Monster Squad get their local &quot;Scary German Guy&quot; (Leonardo Cimino) to translate the diary. When he is told that he knows a lot about monsters, he tells them cryptically &quot;Yes, I suppose I do.&quot; When the children leave his home and he closes the front door, a concentration-camp number tattoo is revealed on his forearm.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093560/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093560/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDirected by Fred Dekker \nProduced by Jonathan A.
