As Ephraim observes, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThey combine church and culture and thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wrong, you cannot do that. \n\nIf thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the way itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s supposed to be then Jesus would have made those rules specific and said ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“You gotta drive a horse with a green harness or you to go hellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. And he didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t say that.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Jesse and Ephraim, along with several other families in the community, gather regularly for bible study classes, which is strictly forbidden by the bishops.\n\n\nThese two radical Amish men, Ephraim and Jesse Stoltzfus, start to question some of the most fundamental aspects of their Amish culture, they face excommunication from their church and total rejection by their friends and family.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:796be030627c564ff4a93161f175d914acf6846d","amp;dn":"Trouble+in+Amish+Paradise+2009+04+07+BBC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"796be030627c564ff4a93161f175d914acf6846d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,107,224,48,98,124,86,79,244,169,49,97,241,117,217,20,172,246,132,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
