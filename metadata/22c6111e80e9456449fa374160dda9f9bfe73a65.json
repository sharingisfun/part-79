This way you have a separate chat for every contact with whom you exchange short text messages like in IM programs. Multiple sms sending, templates, call back, clickable links.  \n\nUsing SMS on a Windows Mobile device can be annoying because the messages aren't threaded. This is a feature that we've hoped Microsoft would have included by now, but they haven't. VITO Technology has recently released a solution for those \nof us that crave IM-like SMS conversations as found in other operating systems. Is SMS-Chat just a novelty, or does it make SMS much more usable? Read on to see!\n\nThe hot factor for this application is that it threads the messages together. It is not as sophisticated as other applications that thread messages such as Extreme Text on the Motorola Q, however SMS-Chat works with the operating system rather than the make of phone, so it has more usability despite being a less sophisticated product. There is certainly room for development as you'll see soon.\n\n\n\n                                   Features:\n\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Templates for quick answers\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Forward, resend or delete messages\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Active links and phone numbers, onscreen alerts\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Multiple sms sending\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22c6111e80e9456449fa374160dda9f9bfe73a65","amp;dn":"VITO+SMS-Chat+Version+1.25+For+The+Pocket+PC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22c6111e80e9456449fa374160dda9f9bfe73a65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,198,17,30,128,233,69,100,73,250,55,65,96,221,169,249,191,231,58,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
