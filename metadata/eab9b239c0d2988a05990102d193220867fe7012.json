Electing to keep a video journal to memorialize their bizarre pact, they plot in secret, devising a homemade death chamber that will allow them to see, hear, feel, and linger over their intended victim's torment and final moments of life. Then, chosen at random, a fellow student becomes this victim when she is to receive perhaps the most brutal and horrifying of all fates. The default leader of this macabre trio directs the physical and psychological terror, even as contention and hostility within the group threatens to jeopardize their twisted plan, culminating in a violent and chilling conclusion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eab9b239c0d2988a05990102d193220867fe7012","amp;dn":"Meadowoods.2010.STV.DVDRip.XViD-SPRiNTER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eab9b239c0d2988a05990102d193220867fe7012","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,185,178,57,192,210,152,138,5,153,1,2,209,147,34,8,103,254,112,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
