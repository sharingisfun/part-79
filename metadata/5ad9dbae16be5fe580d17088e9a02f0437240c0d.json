As violence escalates on both sides, children shoot soldiers at point-blank range, women plant bombs in cafÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©s, and French soldiers resort to torture to break the will of the insurgents. Shot in the streets of Algiers in documentary style, the film is a case study in modern warfare, with its terrorist attacks and the brutal techniques used to combat them. The Criterion Collection is proud to present Gillo Pontecorvo's tour de force a film with astonishing relevance today.\n\n\n# - New high-definition digital transfer, enhanced for widescreen televisions\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ad9dbae16be5fe580d17088e9a02f0437240c0d","amp;dn":"The+Battle+of+Algiers%28Criterion+Collection%29DVDR+NTSC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ad9dbae16be5fe580d17088e9a02f0437240c0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,217,219,174,22,190,95,229,128,209,112,136,233,160,47,4,55,36,12,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
