Plus it takes the pressure off my seed-machine. And It can use some relief now.. :-)\n\nAnd for the blind it's the only way besides Braille to actually hear/read the Word of God.\n\nAnd like Jesus said when they asked Him whether it was right to pay tax to the emperor or not and they showed Him a coin:\n- &quot;Whose picture and name is on it?&quot;\n- &quot;The Emperor's&quot;\n- &quot;Then give the Emperor what is his and God what is God's&quot;\n\nWell, whose Name and face is on the cover of &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot;, &quot;Gospel of John&quot;, &quot;Word of Promise - NKJV Dramatized&quot;?\nJesus' face! So give His Words to the world and let the world have their own, if they won't receive these, but at least you are giving people a choice if you help spread His Words in this way.. Right?\n\nLike the description say; this is the New King James Version New Testament Dramatized. I've heard this before, but the sample wasn't very good, so in this upload it's double the bit-rate. That way the voices doesn't sound like they come from a tin-can. Actually resembles more the human voice than a Edison wax-cylinder. It's more like &quot;Your Master's Voice&quot;, actually.. :-)\n\nI must, in all honesty, tell you that I found this (finally) on the net somewhere, and I thank the original uploader &quot;TV_Dude&quot; for it. It was included in the whole Bible as Audio book, then I reassembled it, tagged it properly, and even threw in a little cover art in the tagging. That way it shows what you're listening to on you iPods or what ever you use for heart-washing and cleansing yourselves in the bath of the Water of Life, God's Word. The whole thing fits nicely onto a standard CD too.. In mp3 quality, that is..\n\nThe voice of Jesus is that of the actor that portrayed Him in &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;, by the way.. Take good care of it. One day the Words in these books and your knowledge of them will be the only thing that stand between you and a heartless world. Treasure this. Make copies. Store some. Give them away. Freely.. :-)\n\nGod bless you all.\n\nVerifire.\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;f58390879c939c879098949c99b59298949c99db969a98&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98b1c5be589161c80654ec5ac072002a370dbe09","amp;dn":"NKJV+Dramatized+-+Word+of+Promise+%5Bmp3%4064%5D%5BVerifire%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98b1c5be589161c80654ec5ac072002a370dbe09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,177,197,190,88,145,97,200,6,84,236,90,192,114,0,42,55,13,190,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
