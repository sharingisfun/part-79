In their groundbreaking book, Turin Shroud: In Whose Image?, from the mid-90s, they claimed the relic, that some venerate as Christ's burial cloth, was actually a medieval creation-- this was also the conclusion an Italian scientist recently arrived at after conducting tests (see article below). However, Picknett was critical of the scientist's work-- though he recreated a likeness of the shroud's image, he didn't replicate the unique characteristics found in the cloth, she said.\n\nPrince and Picknett believe the Shroud was faked by Leonardo da Vinci, who used his own face as a model. Because the facial image has the properties of a photograph, they suggest he used a camera obscura, an early photographic device, to project his image onto the cloth. Further, da Vinci's painting of Salvatore Mundi bears a close resemblance to the face on the Shroud (see comparison images), which the authors find to be compelling evidence of his involvement.\n\nIn examining the historical life of Jesus through the gospels and other texts, the biggest mystery is the mix of Jewish and pagan elements that run through his teachings, said Prince. He may have been trying to resolve the contradictions between the monotheistic Tribe of Judah, and the Samaritans, ancient Israelites, who had certain views that differed, he continued. They also talked about the life of Simon Magus, a Samaritan who was a contemporary of Jesus-- Christians called him the &quot;first heretic.&quot;\n\nMoscow 'Halo' Cloud\n\nAppearing briefly in the first half-hour, UFO expert Nick Pope commented on the glowing 'halo' cloud seen over Moscow. He suggested it may have been generated by a rare meteorological event, possibly involving atmospheric plasma.\n\nWebsite(s):\npicknettprince.com\n\nBook(s):\nTurin Shroud: In Whose Image?\nThe Sion Revelation\nThe Stargate Conspiracy\nThe Masks of Christ\n\n\n\nbrought to you by:\n                                                \n .d8888b.                                                      888    \nd88P  Y88b                                                     888    \n888    888                                                     888    \n888    888 888  888  .d88b.  888d888 .d8888b  8888b.  .d8888b  888888 \n888    888 888  888 d8P  Y8b 888P&quot;  d88P&quot;        &quot;88b 88K      888    \n888    888 Y88  88P 88888888 888    888      .d888888 &quot;Y8888b. 888    \nY88b  d88P  Y8bd8P  Y8b.     888    Y88b.    888  888      X88 Y88b.  \n &quot;Y8888P&quot;    Y88P    &quot;Y8888  888     &quot;Y8888P &quot;Y888888  88888P'  &quot;Y888 \n\nTorrents: http://thepiratebay.se/user/0vercast/\nRSS: http://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/2eb7e342dacfa8938e79732ad03e1224","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd1cf8975cf60783e2d8d5da30e1990df34594e5","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+AM+-+Oct+12+2009+-+Shroud+of+Turin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd1cf8975cf60783e2d8d5da30e1990df34594e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,28,248,151,92,246,7,131,226,216,213,218,48,225,153,13,243,69,148,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
