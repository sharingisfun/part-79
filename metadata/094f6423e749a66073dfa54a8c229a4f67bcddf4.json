As a result, James must get a summer job to cover his upcoming expenses at the decrepit local amusement park, Adventureland, where he falls in love with a witty co-worker, Emily Lewin.  In that bizarrely shady workplace, the young carnies have unforgettable and painful learning experiences about life, love and trust while James discovers what he truly values.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPersonally, I find Kristen Stewart to be one of the most attractive and likable young actresses to hit Hollywood in the last decade.  I think it's because she's probably the most attractive &quot;Girl Next Door&quot; I've ever seen, and her own habits, especially the way she's always pushing that beautiful brown hair out of her face.  Many people have become Kristen Stewart fans since she signed on to do [i]Twilight[/i], but I actually saw her beauty in just the tiny part she had as the older sister in [i]Zathura[/i] and the even more tiny part in [i]Jumper[/i].\n\nBut if you're the kind of person who thinks she's pretty and you don't really see the attraction that all the [i]Twilight[/i] fans do ... this is the film that will make you fall in love with her.  While she didn't get top billing and she isn't the main character of the film, Kristen Stewart steals the show with only half the screen time as that of her co-star.\n\nIf you like films about summer romances that blossom during the worst possible summer jobs, all set during the 1980s ... this is a film you have to see.  It's cute, it's funny, and it's just fucked up enough to be true ...\n\n\nOh ... and true film aficionados ... there is one scene you may get an entertaining laugh from ... when Em takes James home after work the first time, they pass by the glowing sign of Monroeville Mall, the location from Romero's Dawn of the Dead ... :D\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                Additional Info\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike all my iPod torrents, these files have their ID3 tags preformatted for your ease!  Album Art, Release Dates, and TV Tags are already filled out for you.  However, if you wish to change them, I recommend the third-party tagging program TVTagger found here by searching Google for &quot;iPod TVTagger&quot;.\n\nAfter downloading, please leave your client open and the torrent actively seeding so others may download as well and your ratio will remain high!  Also remember not to severely limit your upload speed by over-throttling.  Be kind, rewind!  Remember to eat your green vegetables.
