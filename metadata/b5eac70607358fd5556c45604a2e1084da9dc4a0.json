Including a particularly disturbing visit to the Afghanistan football staidum (soccer) that is instead used for executions. Not especially original, but you are guaranteed to have found out some significant things you never knew about Afghanistan after the documentary is finished. I strongly recommend this documentary to anyone who are interested in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a VHS rip I recorded on 9-22-2001 there are some reporters in the beginning\n\n for about 8 mins talking about the attack so I left them in then the show starts. \n\nApporx 49 min.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5eac70607358fd5556c45604a2e1084da9dc4a0","amp;dn":"Beneath+the+Veil+%282001%29+%28TV%29+%28RARE+TORRENT%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5eac70607358fd5556c45604a2e1084da9dc4a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,234,199,6,7,53,143,213,85,108,69,96,74,46,16,132,218,157,196,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
