Might want to give Open Home a look. Similar to the other home replacement applications Open Home gives you additional Home screens, 7 total. Unlike aHome or dxTop, Open Home only slides either left or right, not up or down.\n\nThe developer, Better Android, already has a number of themes available and is being assisted by users over on xda-developer forum. Better Android is offering a free copy of the full application to the original artists of any available themes. The wording in the theme descriptions seem to imply he may have modified them from themes intended for another purpose and without the artistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s permission. I hope that isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t the case, as it would be a copyright violation. Several of the themes are quite nice, a few donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t suit my taste nevertheless, are nicely done.\nSoft keyboard on home screen\n\nSoft Keyboard on Home Screen\n\nWhat makes Open Home standout at the moment is the newly Open Home ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Cupcake Full edition giving users a peak at the infamous Cupcake update, expected in April in the U.S. The demo features Live Folders and touch screen keyboard (search only) , screen rotation and something called Rename Work Space. Cupcake has additional upgrades beyond what Open Home can emulate at the moment most of which are beyond what Better Android could develop with the current API release.\n\nTo demo Live Folders install the Live Folders demo. This demo offers two previews, Contacts With Numbers and All Contacts. When added to the Home screen and launched each Live Folder displays contacts with a translucent background that appears like a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwindowedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ application. I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have any trouble with All Contacts but Contacts With Phone Numbers displayed contacts multiple times and when a contact was selected displayed the wrong one, proof this is in fact a demo.\n\nAdditional features shown is an application dock which appears on the right side of the screen as a white star. The white star is difficult to see on the default skin, so be sure to look for it. In portrait mode a small magnifying glass appears on the left side when activated switches to whichever screen has the search window and shows the on-screen keyboard. The keyboard is responsive enough, certainly as responsive as the iPhone or StormÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s on-screen keyboards. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not a fan of on-screen typing but is handy for a quick one or two word search without opening the keyboard.\nApplication Dock\n\nApplication Dock\n\nThe last feature worth noting is the auto-rotating screen giving Android the much sought after ability of the iPhone and S60 devices for quite some time. Auto-rotate works reasonably well although could use a sliding sensitivity setting for better sensitivity if desired. Auto-rotate will be handy for those few apps the donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t fit on the screen in landscape or portrait however, without a landscape on-screen keyboard its functionality is less useful.\n\nAll of these options can be enabled or disabled from Open HomeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s settings. There is an option for Renaming Work Space. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not sure what is defined as Work Space. I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t find any area that could be renames, as such appears to be a useless option at the moment.\n\nBetter Android is offering this application for $2.99 until more features are available, persumably when Cupcake is released. Better Android says this update is nearly the same as the Lite edition but also states the Cupcake edition may or may not go up in price with Cupcakes release. For this reason I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know I would recommend purchasing this app just yet. I might just stick with the lite version at least until Cupcake is released.\n\n\n\n\nCOMPATIBLE WITH 1.6 (Donut) release.  Will resolve the constant force-close that occurs on 1.6 with the older version of OpenHome.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4483abfe076358508b7c0d10ca6ed7715909a5c","amp;dn":"OpenHome+for+Android+%28G1%2C+Mytouch%2C+Hero%2C+Dream%2C+etc%29+compatible+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4483abfe076358508b7c0d10ca6ed7715909a5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,72,58,191,224,118,53,133,8,183,192,209,12,166,237,119,21,144,154,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
