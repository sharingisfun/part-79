A successful and lucrative term in office is the\n goal! Absolute Power is packed with new missions, new islands and a whole\n host of new gameplay features.\n Features\n * New campaign featuring 10 missions on a separate map with 10 islands\n   which   are also available in sandbox mode\n * New buildings (including Garbage Dump, Marina, Small Garage, Children's  \n   Playground, and more...) and a new buildings category for current and new\n     decorations with individual icon models\n * New Megalomania Edicts - demonstrate your absolute power by ordering the  \n    construction of a huge golden statue of Tropico's top export, declaring\n   an   annual festival dedicated to yourself or even print your own money!\n * Six New Landmarks  build huge decorations and structures which dominate  \n   the island landscape and make each island unique.\n * New Faction - The Loyalist Faction are your die-hard supporters and want  \n    no elections (since El Presidente is obviously the best candidate) and\n   want a   statue on every corner!\n * Faction Disasters - Low standing with any island faction will trigger new\n     disasters if not addressed\n * New Intro and Win/Lose Cutscenes\n * Four Additional Avatar Costumes  Two for male and two for female avatars\n * Beautification upgrades for the presidential palace including rooftop  \n   pool, extra towers, flags, banners and a larger balcony (which will\n   increase   the effects of balcony speeches)\n * More icons displaying the status of buildings and displaying input/output\n     storage numbers for selected buildings\n * Prevalent Faction - In every sandbox game one faction is chosen as  \n   &quot;prevalent&quot; on the island. Members of this faction will be especially\n   numerous   throughout the entire game and their satisfaction will be more\n   important than   usual\n * More radio announcements to guide you through Tropico's daily life\n * Gravel Roads  A second type of road for rural areas with decreased travel\n     speed\n            ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œ ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸   Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œ  ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œ Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Âº   Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Âº   ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œ ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œ Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œ  ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸  ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸\n ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â° Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â°  Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Âº ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â° Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â°  ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œ Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â°ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Âº Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â°   Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â°   Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â°  Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Âº Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â°  Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Âº Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â°  ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œ Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œ ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â° ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸\n            ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸     ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸   ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸    ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸     ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸   ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸  ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸\n 1.
