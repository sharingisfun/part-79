The network map on a computer running Windows Vista shows a graphical view of the computers and devices on your network and how they are connected by using the LLTD protocol. The LLTD responder must be installed on a computer running Windows XP before it can be detected and appear on the network map. After you install this item, you may have to restart your computer.\n\n\nArticle:\n\nNetwork Map Does Not Display Computers Running Windows XP\n\nUpdated: July 9, 2009\n\nApplies To: Windows Vista\n\nWhen you run Network Map in Windows VistaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, computers that are running WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® XP do not appear on the completed diagram.\nCause\n\nNetwork Map in Windows Vista diagrams the connections between network devices to help you troubleshoot connectivity problems. Network Map uses a discovery protocol called Link-Layer Topology Discovery (LLTD) in order to query the other devices on the network to determine how the network is organized. Computers that are running Windows Vista include the software components that implement the LLTD protocol. For network computers that are running Windows XP to appear on the map, they must have a discovery protocol enabled that can respond to the mapping computer's requests.\nSolution on Windows XP\n\nFor computers running Windows XP to appear on the Network Map diagram, you must download and install the LLTD Responder component. By installing the LLTD Responder, and enabling File and Printer Sharing in Windows Firewall, a computer running Windows XP can respond to other Windows Vista computers on the network that are attempting to create a network map.\n\nThe following procedures are performed on a computer running Windows XP.\n\nTo install the LLTD Responder onto a computer running Windows XP\n\n   1. Download the update appropriate for your version of Windows:\n\n          * If you are running Windows XP with no service pack, with Service Pack 1 (SP1), or with SP2, download the update from here: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=70582.\n\n   2.
