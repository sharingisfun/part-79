In his provocative documentary film, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDeconstructing the Myth of AIDSÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, Gary Null, Ph.D., challenges virtually every statement ever made by the American medical industrial complex on the virus - including those of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institute for Health (NIH) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). \n\nWhile presenting the findings of Nobel Prize-winning scientists and leading virologists, the film exposes the political maneuvering, conspiracies and cover-ups that have provided obstacles to the study of this human catastrophe from the start. For example, there are experts who believe that AIDS is the result of multiple factors, including drug use, stress and nutritional deficiency, but that government agencies made a politically strategic decision to de-emphasize these hypotheses and thus discourage certain researchers and their funding. \n\nMeanwhile, AZT, an infamously failed treatment for cancer, and now the primary FDA-approved approach to treating AIDS, is highly toxic and can produce the very symptoms of the illness it is prescribed to treat. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDeconstructing the Myth of AIDSÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ goes beyond medicine and science to question the very foundation of our reliance on government bureaucracies where it concerns matters of life and death.\n\n\n*** General Parameters ***\n- Name: Deconstructing the Myth of AIDS - Gary Null.mp4\n- Container: MP4 - QuickTime\n- Creation Date: 2007-10-05 9:05:20 PM\n- Size: 366.7 MiB\n- Duration: 2:09:49\n- Bitrate: 394 Kbps\n\n*** Video Track Parameters ***\n- Format: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC\n- Bitrate: Max.: 728 Kbps\n   Average: 302 Kbps\n   Min.: Undefined\n- Frame rate (fps): Max.: ---\n   Average: 29.970\n   Min.: ---\n- Resolution: 24 bits\n- Width (Pixel number): 320\n- Height (Pixel number): 240\n\n*** Audio Track(s) Parameters ***\n- Format: AAC - MPEG-4 audio\n- Bitrate: 90.6 Kbps\n- Resolution: 16 bits\n- Channel(s): 2 (stereo)\n\n*** Miscellaneous ***\n- Subtitle(s): No Subtitle\n\n\nComment: \n\nAlso download my other torrent &quot;Healing AIDS with Microcurrents and Nanosilver&quot;. There are two possibilities now: Either HIV does exist or it does not exist. If HIV really exists, then in all likelihood it can be eliminated by colloidal silver. If HIV does not exist though, then of course it cannot be eliminated by colloidal silver. But if AIDS hasn't been caused by HIV, then it would be quite useless to fight it, since there is nothing to fight against. Then it is about healing your body's own defense mechanisms. \n\nHaving AIDS means that there are many secondary diseases as a result of a weakened immune system - whatever the cause of that weakness may be. There may be innumerable causes. AIDS may appear as a result of many causes acting together. But of course colloidal silver can then be used to get rid of secondary infections such as pneumonia.\n\nColloidal silver is merciless - it even eliminates bio-warfare agents such as Anthrax. Why is it that your &quot;government&quot; has never told you about this? They know the efficiency of colloidal silver, and considering how worried they pretend to be when it comes to protecting people from terrorism, why then don't they protect people from Anthrax by giving them colloidal silver? Perhaps they want people to be scared. Perhaps they can make more money by keeping or making people sick than by healing people.\n\nColloidal silver is both highly effective and its toxicity is much lower than that of antibiotics of comparable strength. Although colloidal silver is much less toxic than most medical drugs, it is certainly wiser to look at the causes of AIDS. Causes of AIDS may be bad nutrition, stress, drug abuse, alcohol, mercury in vaccinations, amalgam in your teeth, conventional venereal diseases, microwave radiation, fluoride in your toothpaste, chemtrails, chlorine in your drinking water, insecticides and additives in your food and drinks, and so on. \n\nBut as an emergency measure, it may be wise to temporarily use colloidal silver to help your body help itself. Ultimately no doctor has ever healed a patient. Doctors and healers simply create an environment, both mental and physical to facilitate your body-mind's ability to heal itself by itself.\n\n\ntags: deconstructing,myth,AIDS,Gary Null,HIV,CDC,NIH,FDA,virus,health,healing,infection,AZT,conspiracy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b23beb8b9c95dbd6fc3f427280725fcc91e9254","amp;dn":"Deconstructing+the+Myth+of+AIDS+-+Gary+Null","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b23beb8b9c95dbd6fc3f427280725fcc91e9254","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,35,190,184,185,201,93,189,111,195,244,39,40,7,37,252,201,30,146,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
