The module was published by TSR, Inc. in 1985 for the first edition Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons rules. It was written by Gary Gygax and Frank Mentzer, and is an expansion of an earlier Gygax module, The Village of Hommlet (TSR, 1979)[1]. The Temple of Elemental Evil is also the title of a related 2001 Thomas M. Reid novel and an Atari computer game, and the term is used by fans of the setting to refer to the fictional Temple itself.\n\nThe Temple of Elemental Evil was ranked the 4th greatest Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine in 2004, on the 30th anniversary of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game.[2]\n\nMount the image(s).
