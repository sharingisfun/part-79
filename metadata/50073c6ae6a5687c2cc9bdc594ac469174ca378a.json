The accompanying PowerPoint MP3 audio file and video should also be available online.\n\nVisit:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.localfuture.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.localfuture.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.aaronwissner.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.aaronwissner.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBio\n\n\nAaron Wissner is a public school educator of seventeen years and founder of Local Future educational nonprofit.
