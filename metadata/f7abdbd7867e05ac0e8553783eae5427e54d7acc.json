He asked me to upload it to get it out there. Please don't expect Scorsese. It is a college project. I had nothing to do with the writing or making of it. I'm just trying to get it out there for my friend. It's horrorish, with a sex scene. No nudity however. There is some obscene language. The run time is just over 15 minutes, and there is 20 seconds at the beginning that is black. Enjoy!\n\nPlease comment with your thoughts on the film. I will pass the comments on to my friend. Thank you for downloading.\n\nAVI Information\nFilename: Party.Of.Doom.avi\nFilesize: 262150144 Bytes (250.01 MB)\nStreams (i.e. Video, Audio): 2\nVideo Stream\n\nCompression: xvid - XVID MPEG-4\nAvg.
