She walks out telling him that he's on his own. Sasha is less than the friend she ought to be to Nicki when Nicki needs someone to talk to, prioritising her valuable studio time over friendship. Nicki is unhappy with having to work, and having to work in a dodgy designer-label-free shop! Her conscience gets the better of her when she decides not to lift money from the till. In one of the funniest sequences in the series so far Jamie and Sooz try to tell someone the truth about their relationship but end up putting their collective feet in it with the Sasha/Nicki situation. They eventually resort to telling Alex who gives a typical Alex response finding it both funny and disgusting! Finally, after a bit of female bonding with an altogether more amicable Sooz, Nicki ditches her job (and her clothes) in a fantastic display of defiance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44ecbf1cbafa6d47a2850820bffe7480c08f876f","amp;dn":"As+If+2x07+Nicki%5C%27s+POV.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44ecbf1cbafa6d47a2850820bffe7480c08f876f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,236,191,28,186,250,109,71,162,133,8,32,191,254,116,128,192,143,135,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
