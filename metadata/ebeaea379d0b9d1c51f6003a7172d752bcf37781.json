Notable songs written by Green and/or his wife, Melody Green, include &quot;Your Love Broke Through,&quot; &quot;You Put This Love In My Heart,&quot; and &quot;Asleep In The Light,&quot; as well as the popular modern hymns &quot;O Lord, You're Beautiful&quot; and &quot;There Is A Redeemer.&quot;\n\nKeith had a Jewish and Christian Science background but grew up reading the New Testament. He called it &quot;an odd combination&quot; that left him open minded but deeply unsatisfied. He began doing drugs and became interested in South Asian mysticism and &quot;free love.&quot; After experiencing what Green described as a &quot;bad trip,&quot; he abandoned drug use and became bitter towards philosophy and theology in general. Green later stated, however, that in the midst of his skepticism, he felt that God &quot;broke through [his] calloused heart,&quot; and he became a born-again Christian. Soon afterward, Keith's wife Melody (whom he had married on Christmas Day 1973) also became a born-again Christian. It was during this time that the newlyweds became involved with the Vineyard Christian Fellowship in Southern California.\n\n\nIn 1975, the Greens began an outreach program in the suburbs of Los Angeles, California, in the San Fernando Valley. Purchasing the home next door to their own and renting an additional five in the same neighborhood, Keith and Melody provided a environment of Christian teaching for a group of young adults, the majority of whom were of college age. Much to the consternation of neighbors, those living in the Green's homes included former drug addicts, the homeless and even some prostitutes who had been referred to the Greens by other ministries and shelters.\n\n\nIn 1977, the Greens outreach was officially named Last Days Ministries.\nKeith Green's initial tone of ministry was largely influenced by Leonard Ravenhill, who pointed Keith to Charles Finney, a nineteenth century revivalist preacher who preached the law of God to provoke conviction in his hearers. During his concerts he would often exhort his listeners to repent and commit themselves more wholly to following Christ. Green later softened his approach, and this transition is evident in his music beginning with So You Wanna Go Back To Egypt in 1980.\n\n\nAlong with eleven others, Keith Green died on July 28, 1982, when the Cessna 414 leased by Last Days Ministries crashed after takeoff from the private airstrip located on the LDM property. The small two-engine plane was carrying eleven passengers and the pilot, Don Burmeister for an aerial tour[12] of the LDM property and the surrounding area. Green and two of his children, three year old Josiah and two year old Bethany, were on board the plane, along with visiting missionaries John and Dede Smalley and their six children.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebeaea379d0b9d1c51f6003a7172d752bcf37781","amp;dn":"Rare+teaching+videos+of+Keith+Green+-+Over+6.5+hours+%21%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebeaea379d0b9d1c51f6003a7172d752bcf37781","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,234,234,55,157,11,157,28,81,246,0,58,113,114,215,82,188,243,119,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
