Harry Nilsson was one of the great Pop/Rock mavericks. He wrote hit songs for other artists (including 'Cuddly Toy' by The Monkees and 'One' by Three Dog Night) yet his two biggest hit singles were his covers of Badfinger's 'Without You' and Fred Neil's 'Everybody's Talkin''. This double-Grammy Award winner never toured yet managed to record with three of the four Beatles (who were big fans) and release albums that reflected where he was at and not always what the charts were looking for. 36 tracks including the aforementioned hits plus '1941', 'Many Rivers To Cross', 'The Puppy Song', 'Me And My Arrow', 'Coconut', 'Think About Your Troubles', 'All I Think About Is You' and many others.\n\nDisc 01\n\n[01] Without You\n[02] Everybody's Talkin'\n[03] 1941\n[04] Cuddly Toy\n[05] One\n[06] Good Old Desk\n[07] The Puppy Song\n[08] City Life\n[09] Mournin' Glory Story\n[10] I Guess The Lord Must Be In New York City\n[11] Love Story\n[12] Living Without You\n[13] Me And My Arrow\n[14] Are You Sleeping\n[15] Think About Your Troubles\n[16] Without Her\n[17] Coconut\n[18] The Moonbeam Song\n\nDisc 01 Play Time 00h:50m:16s\n\nDisc 02\n\n[01] Remember (Christmas)\n[02] Turn On Your Radio\n[03] The Lottery Song\n[04] It Had To Be You\n[05] Makin' Whoopee!\n[06] I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now\n[07] Mucho Mungo--Mt.
