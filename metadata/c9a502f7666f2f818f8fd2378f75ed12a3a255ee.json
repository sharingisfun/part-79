The complex relationships between species and their environments, the pressure of natural selection and spontaneous mutations, between chance and necessity, have fashioned the living world in a multitude of forms, beyond our imaginations. And although scientists and biologists have already made great strides towards illuminating the extent and variety of the web of life, our knowledge of certain species is still very limited, in particular those that are isolated or difficult to access.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 349 MiB for 43mn 12s 392ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nLanguage          : English\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Nature/Science\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 993 Kbps\nAspect            : 576 x 336 (1.714) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 122 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9a502f7666f2f818f8fd2378f75ed12a3a255ee","amp;dn":"CBC-The+Nature+of+Things.S50E3.WS-PDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9a502f7666f2f818f8fd2378f75ed12a3a255ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,165,2,247,102,111,47,129,143,143,210,55,143,117,237,18,163,162,85,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
