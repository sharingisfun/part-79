Around 60 aircraft ranging from \nfighters, attack aircraft, helicopters, tanker and airborne early warning aircraft will \noperate from air bases located in Germany, the Czech Republic, France, Poland, and \nUK. In addition, tactical employment of Theatre Missile Defence and Ground Based \nAir Defence assets will be extensively exercised. \n\nThe aim of the exercise is to validate nominated Air Forces to NATO Response Force \n15 (NRF), which starts July 2010. The exercise is also open to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnon NRFÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ air units \nfrom NATO, as well as Partnership for Peace (PfP) nations. The exercise scenario is \nbased around a UN mandated NATO-led Crisis Response Operation (CRO) in a \nfictitious geo-political setting, a scenario specifically designed for this exercise. The \nNRF concept provides the Alliance with a robust capability to meet the challenging \nsecurity environment of the 21st century by providing a highly trained and agile \nforce, at high readiness, able to deploy at short notice wherever and whenever \ndirected to do so by the North Atlantic Council. \n\nA Media Day will be held at Laage Air Base, Germany, on Monday, 19 April 2010. \nThe Media Day programme will include a News Conference, a guided tour of Laage \nAir Base also including a static aircraft display, and finally, demonstration of taking \noff and landing of a/c by the Italian Air Force unit, deployed to Laage Air Base, \nprotected by defence counter-air system.\n \nA NATO Media Information Centre (NMIC) will be established at Laage Air Base, \nGermany, and will be operational from 12 to 22 April 2010. It will serve as a central \ncoordination hub for the real life media interface. \n\nThose media members wishing to cover the Media Day of Exercise Brilliant Ardent \n2010 (BAT 10) are kindly invited to contact the German Air Force CommandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Public \nAffairs Office and Allied Air Command Izmir PAO, well in advance, register, and \nreport to Laage Air Base on the 19th April 2010, by 09.45 hrs at the latest. This \ninvitation is also extended to the media members wishing to visit the German Air \nbases that participate in the Exercise BAT 10 throughout the entire exercise. \n\n\nCONCEN NEWS CONCEN NEWS CONCEN NEWS CONCEN NEWS CONCEN NEWS CONCEN NEWS CONCEN NEWS CONCEN\n\n\nApril 17 (Bloomberg) -- European airlines canceled more than 77 percent of their flights today as \nmost of the continentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s northern and central nations remained closed to air traffic because of \nvolcanic ash. Accuweather predicted little change until April 22. \n\nNo flights will operate out of the U.K. until at least 1 p.m. London time tomorrow, the National Air \nTraffic Service said today via e-mail. German airports will remain closed until 2 p.m. Berlin time, \nthe DFS air traffic control agency said. The European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation, or \nEurocontrol, expects about 5,000 flights across Europe today, compared with 22,000 on a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnormalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \nSaturday, it said today in a statement. \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œExpect ongoing interruptions for the next four or five days,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Teitur Atlason, at the Icelandic \nmeteorological office, said in a telephone interview today. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe eruption is still in full swing, and \nthe volcano is spewing pretty dark ashes as high into the air as 5 to 6 kilometers.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \nFlights were grounded after April 14 when an eruption at the EyjafjallajÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶kull volcano spewed dust \nacross thousands of miles of European airspace, closing terminals from Dublin to Moscow. The \ndirection of winds high in the atmosphere mean the disruption may go on for the next few days. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“No Signs of ChangeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe jet stream winds, which extend from 10,000 feet up to 40,000 feet, show no signs of change \nthrough Wednesday,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Accuweather said in a statement. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAny ash plume that is released from the \nEyjafjall volcano in Iceland will continue to threaten northern Europe and the British isles.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\n\nCONCEN NEWS CONCEN NEWS CONCEN NEWS CONCEN NEWS CONCEN NEWS CONCEN NEWS CONCEN NEWS CONCEN\n\n\nAccording to a United States Air Forces in Europe news \nstory, participation by U.S. Air Forces in Europe units \ndirectly aligns with the command key mission areas of \nproviding forces for global operations and building \npartnership. \n\n\nCONCEN NEWS CONCEN NEWS CONCEN NEWS CONCEN NEWS CONCEN NEWS CONCEN NEWS CONCEN NEWS CONCEN\n\n\nWhat a coincidence as well, our defense minister actually is atm \nin Turkey, after his Afghanistan visit. \nIt is reported he also won't travel back by plane.\n\n\nCONCEN NEWS CONCEN NEWS CONCEN NEWS CONCEN NEWS CONCEN NEWS CONCEN NEWS CONCEN NEWS CONCEN\n\n\nWhat is going on in the skies over Europe? Here in Switzerland there aren't any ashes from Iceland \nand yet airspace over Switzerland has been shut down completely. This has never ever happened before\nhere. There have been many volcano eruptions in Europe in the past decades, especially in Italy, but\nairspace has never been shut down over Switzerland. We even had sand on our cars from storms in the\nSahara Desert in the past decades. Sand hurts the engines of airplanes much more than ashes, and yet \nairspace was never closed down because of desert storms. Something is fishy here. I don't know what \nit is, but something is going on here...\n\nIf you watch the videos about the volcanic eruption in Iceland included in this torrent, then\nyou can clearly see that there is no real volcano there, but just a glowing hole in the ground\nreleasing rather insignificant amounts of ashes. Shutting down airspace over Iceland would have\nbeen reasonable, but shutting down airspace all over Europe because of that glowing hole is\nsimply ridiculous. \n\nNow, could this Icelandic hole have been created by HAARP? Possibly, but rather unlikely. As\nfar as we know, there was no earthquake in Iceland, and triggering a volcanic eruption without\nan earthquake seems unlikely. On the other hand, that hole being so small it could well have\nbeen caused by conventional explosives. In Iceland there is a special geological structure,\nmolten lava is very close to the surface there. It doesn't take much to open up that surface\nin order to release some lava and ashes.\n\nAs you may know, global warming is a huge hoax, and now the very same type of scientists tell\nus that there is a new threat, not global warming, but global ashes. It seems that the Illuminati\nsimply have to create one terror after the other to prevent people from developing spiritually\nby distracting them with external events, and to control them with fear.\n\nPerhaps there is a connection with chemtrails. It is amazing what a clear blue sky we had today \nover Switzerland. I haven't seen this in along time. Perhaps they wanted that clear blue sky over\nEurope to have a kind of reference-sky. If you want to see how effective chemtrails are, then\nyou need a reference to compare it to. That's a basic science-principle.\n\nOn the other hand, perhaps the Freemasons wanted to perform a magick ritual and they\nneeded that clear sky to perform it properly. Or perhaps it simply because NATO is preparing\nan attack against Iran and they had to clear the sky to prevent any interference with\ncivilian air traffic. Perhaps NATO simply needed a clear sky to make their surveillance and radar\nsystems work properly.\n\nAs you can see, there are many options. It's up to you now to question authority and think\nfor yourself. Perhaps I'm all wrong. Perhaps the media are telling the truth for once. This is\nhighly unlikely, but not impossible.\n\nAir traffic over Europe is also interesting. There are airplanes up there that shouldn't\nbe there. Included in this torrent is a realtime map of air traffic over Europe. Considering\nthe shut down of airspace not one single airplane should be on that map, but there are many.\n\n\nCONCEN NEWS CONCEN NEWS CONCEN NEWS CONCEN NEWS CONCEN NEWS CONCEN NEWS CONCEN NEWS CONCEN\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f922e927ba2c2500edf40c560fc4dfffed2cb095","amp;dn":"Large+Scale+NATO+Exercise+-+Airspace+Closed+Down","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f922e927ba2c2500edf40c560fc4dfffed2cb095","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,34,233,39,186,44,37,0,237,244,12,86,15,196,223,255,237,44,176,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
