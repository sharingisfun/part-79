Starting July 1st, the 2008 no-budget dark comedy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Moving MenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the 2009 no-budget romantic comedy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAll The Love In The WorldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ will be available on BitTorrent file sharing sites.  Digital Lizard Productions even provide a step by step guide on how to download with BitTorrents on the brand new DigitalLizardProductions.com.\n\nCurrently there are thousands of pending lawsuits against downloaders who have used BitTorrents to illegally acquire movies online. Voltage Pictures, who produced last yearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBest PictureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Academy Award winning ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Hurt LockerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, is leading the illegal downloading hunt by demanding 5,000 BitTorrent users pay a corpulent sum of $1,500 to release them from their suit. With claims that illegal downloading cost cast, crew, and unionized worked jobs all you have to do is look at the numbers. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Hurt LockerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ had a budget of $15 Million and has reportedly grossed well over $40 Million since theatric and DVD release.\n\nDigital Lizard Productions finds this obscene. All artists deserve the right to be fairly compensated for their work, but the actions of these Hollywood producers are far from fair. With the US and global economy struggling, a consumer should expect to get what they pay for. When downloading music one gets to preview the song, one can read a chapter or two of a book with ease at many bookstores, and when purchasing a piece of art from a gallery one gets to take in its value before buying. Sadly, when it comes to a movie the patron has to take the word of the astute promotional trailer editor. Because of this, Digital Lizard Productions is following the business model of recording artist Radiohead and Trent Reznor and are offering their two genuinely independent made movies for free to the downloading audience.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThese movies are far from perfect,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ admits Digital Lizard Productions producer Michael Goodpaster, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbut most big budget movies are far from it as wellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Digital Lizard Productions doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t see this as competing with the larger companies. Their movies are generally under $500 in budget, are cast with local aspiring actors and friends, and shot on location wherever they can within a reasonable driving distance. The stripped down production and production quality are far from the Hollywood standard but that doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t seem to bother Digital Lizard Productions. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s understandable that viewers will be taken back by the no-budget productionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ agrees Michael Goodpaster, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbut at the end of the day we just want to share the evolution of our art and entertain people in the process.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nTheir goal is 5,000 downloads. BitTorrent download links for both ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Moving MenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAll the Love in the WorldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ as well as a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhow toÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ guide are now available at DigitalLizardProductions.com\n\nThe free media content of the newly relaunched DigitalLizardProductions.com does not end there. Along with their first two movies being released free to the downloading public, the company also releases their first web series; a 1980ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s late night talk show titled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Nocturnal Emissions with Steven Thomas DarrellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, a series of Blogs on various entertainment topics, select tracks from the live concerts they have shot in the past, and much more.\n\nAbout Digital Lizard Productions:\nDigital Lizard Productions is an independent media production company. They are the class clown, the art kid in the back of the class, the bad kid outside smoking behind the trees, the outgoing, the weird, and the overly ambitious.  Since creation in 2007 DLP has released two full length feature films, filmed dozens of concerts, and have completed numerous other media projects. With many more independent film releases in various stages of production, more original web seriesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ on the horizon, and other plans Digital Lizard Productions seeks to maintain their ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdo-it-yourselfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ independent mentality while gaining more exposure for the time and talent put in to these projects.\n\n****************************************\n\nThe Moving Men\n\nDirector:\nMichael Goodpaster\n\nWriter:\nMichael Goodpaster (writer)\n\nRelease Date:\n18 February 2008 (USA)\n\nGenre:\nComedy\n\nTagline:\nFriends don't let friends become murderers.\n\nPlot:\nEverything is normal for the three friends until they find themselves in a very vicious cycle of outlandish deaths such as a girl choking to death while blowing up condom after an argument about party favors and a girl plummeting to her death from a motel balcony in the midst of drunken sex.
