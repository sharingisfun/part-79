With over 40 million albums sold, it would seem that he would have nothing left to prove. However, the driven vocalist gloriously bats it out of the park on his upcoming album Hang Cool Teddy Bear, which features special guests including guitarists Brian May of Queen fame and guitar great Stevie Vai.
