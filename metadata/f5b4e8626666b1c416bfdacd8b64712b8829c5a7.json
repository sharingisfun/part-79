Use professionally designed templates that can be branded with your logo and include descriptions to guide recipients through the contents.\nHelp protect your documents\n   Use passwords to help control access to PDF documents. Use permissions to restrict printing, copying, or altering. Save passwords and permissions as security policies that can be easily applied to new PDF files.\nEasily create and manage electronic forms\n   Convert Microsoft Word and Excel documents or scanned paper to PDF forms with automatic recognition of fillable fields. Use AdobeÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® LiveCycleÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Designer software ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a professional form design tool ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ to create, customize, and automate dynamic XML forms.

Then distribute the PDF file and walk recipients through it in real time by controlling the page view they see.\nPermanently remove sensitive information\n   Use redaction tools to black out sensitive text, illustrations, or other information, permanently deleting the content from the PDF document. Inspect PDF documents for metadata, hidden layers, and other concealed information to remove before distributing the files to others.\nCompare PDF documents\n   Automatically highlight the differences between two versions of a PDF document, including text and images, so you can quickly and easily identify what has changed.\nImprove print processes\n   Help control costs and reduce errors with automated output controls to preview, preflight, correct, and prepare PDF files for high-end print production and digital publishing.\nCreate and validate accessible PDF documents","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5b4e8626666b1c416bfdacd8b64712b8829c5a7","amp;dn":"Adobe+Acrobat+9+Professiona.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5b4e8626666b1c416bfdacd8b64712b8829c5a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,180,232,98,102,102,177,196,22,191,218,205,139,100,113,43,136,41,197,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
