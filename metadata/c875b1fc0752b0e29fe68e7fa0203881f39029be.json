But, as the finish line nears, they are\n              faced with perhaps their biggest challenge yet -- a\n              hurricane is barreling down on the Gulf of Mexico,\n              where the Mississippi ends. After traveling so far,\n              will the team be able to complete the 2, 300 mile\n              journey?\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        GREETS:\n                    - FQM - CTU - REVEiLLE - XOXO -","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c875b1fc0752b0e29fe68e7fa0203881f39029be","amp;dn":"National.Geographic.Mississippi.River.Quest.S01E03.Memphis.to.th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c875b1fc0752b0e29fe68e7fa0203881f39029be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,117,177,252,7,82,176,226,159,230,142,127,160,32,56,129,243,144,41,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
