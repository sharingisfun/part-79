Here is day 10 of the May honbasho from the RyÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½goku Kokugikan in Tokyo.  \n\nThis recording was made from digital cable through S-cable, then reprocessed to 720x480 Xvid from its original *.MPG\n\nI will not bother posting the original higher quality *.MPGs this time, as many of you prefer speed over quality (not that there is too much loss in the conversion!)  As before, I will seed until the next basho.\n\n\nPS.  This is in the secondary language: English\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d63b9708e569bdc2e0cc83c346d9c3c4b5099ac","amp;dn":"Natsu+Basho+-+Day+10+-+2010+May+%28Xvid-%2A.AVI%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d63b9708e569bdc2e0cc83c346d9c3c4b5099ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,99,185,112,142,86,155,220,46,12,200,60,52,109,156,60,75,80,153,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
