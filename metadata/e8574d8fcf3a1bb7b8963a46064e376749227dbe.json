Should also work with new iPod Classics. Will not work with iPod 5th gen or 5.5 to my knowledge.\n\nWas informed recently that my encodes will also play on the new Android G1 phone/pda from Google/T-Mobile.\n\nPlease make sure you are running PSP firmware 4.01 or above before claiming the release doesn't work on your PSP.\n\nAll releases tested on PSP firmware 5.00 M33-3 - http://www.dark-alex.org/\n\nI do not test functionality on Apple products, this may or may not work for you on those.\n\nZune 30GB will not sync these directly. Zune software will transcode H.264 files at device sync.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVideo\nDimensions: (480x270 video -&gt; 480x272 frame) (widescreen)\nCodec: H.264 / AVC\nH.264 Level: 21\nCoder: CAVLC\nPasses: 2\nBitrate: 384kb (ABR)\n\nAudio\nCodec: MPEG-4 AAC Audio\nChannels: Stereo\nSample rate: 48000 Hz\nBitrate: 128kb\n\n\nCopy files or folder to /VIDEO on your PSP memory stick.\n\n(or)\n\nSync video files using iTunes to your iPhone, iPod touch or Nano 3G.\n\n(or)\n\nSync video files using Zune software to your Zune.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWant to watch it on the big screen?\n\nHere are a few ways to do that:\n\n1) Do you have a PSP slim? If so buy the TV out cables and direct connect to your tv and play them that way. You can buy regular composite cables, svideo cables, and component cables. I recommend these - http://www.amazon.com/PSP-Slim-Component-Cable-Xbox-360/dp/B00149S0H6/\n\n2) Do you have an XBOX 360 and a PSP? Hook your PSP to your XBOX 360 via the usb mini b cable. Go to the media blade on your 360, select videos, change source, select portable device, navigate to your video.\n\n3) If for some reason you don't have a PSP and you do have an XBOX 360 then you can just put the video files on any usb device and just connect them to your XBOX in the same manner as above.\n\n4) You can also stream the video to your XBOX 360 using Windows Media player 11 or uShare on Linux. To stream via Windows Media Player 11 to XBOX 360 follow this guide http://owlet.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!D48B90C1DDF5D401!297.entry It works fine.\n\n5) Watch via XBMC on your XBOX or Linux HTPC - http://xbmc.org/\n\n6) There is most likely a way to stream this to a PS3 or play via usb device also, but I don't own one, so I can't advise on how to do that.\n\n7) Use Apple TV - http://www.apple.com/appletv/\n\n8) Use either Apple Composite AV Cable or Apple Component AV Cable with your iPhone or iPod touch. http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB128LL/A or http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB129LL/A\n\n9) Use a Popcorn Hour A-110 - http://www.popcornhour.com/onlinestore/\n\n10) Connect your Zune to your Xbox 360 via the usb cable. Go to the media blade on your 360, select videos, change source, select portable device, navigate to your video.\n\nNote: playing mpeg 4 videos on Xbox 360 requires the Dec 2007 video update, refer to http://blogs.msdn.com/xboxteam/archive/2007/11/30/december-2007-video-playback-faq.aspx You may also need to download the optional video pack.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNeed more memory for your PSP?\n\nBuy the new Sony MSMT16G 16GB Memory Stick PRO Duo (Mark2) Media:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Sony-MSMT16G-Memory-Stick-Mark2/dp/B0013AX2HO/\n\n\n\n-HR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8574d8fcf3a1bb7b8963a46064e376749227dbe","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+-+The+Clone+Wars+s01e07+%28PSP%2C+iPhone%2C+iPod+Touch%2C+Nano","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8574d8fcf3a1bb7b8963a46064e376749227dbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,87,77,143,207,58,27,183,184,150,58,70,6,78,55,103,73,34,125,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
