Records US, Bronze Records UK \nProducer Gerry Bron \n\n\nFirefly is the tenth album released by British rock band Uriah Heep. It was first album without David Byron, lead vocalist and a founder-member of the band, and the first of three albums with John Lawton.\n\nBassist Trevor Bolder made his Heep-debut on this album and has been (almost) ever-present since, bar a break of about 18 months in 1981-82.\n\nThe single from the album was &quot;Wise Man&quot;. Also, &quot;Sympathy&quot; became a hit which was crucial for fans to accept the new lineup.\n\n&quot;Who Needs Me&quot; was written by drummer Lee Kerslake and is about his unhappiness at the rejection, by manager and label boss Gerry Bron, of pretty-much any material by any one other than Ken Hensley. This is ultimately somewhat ironic, given the song's acceptance for recording.\n\nKerslake was credited as Lee &quot;The Bear&quot; Kerslake on this album only, due to his strong physical build and then newly-acquired beard growth.\n\nThe original vinyl album was a gatefold sleeve, with a cardboard lyric-liner.\n\nAll songs written by Ken Hensley, except where noted\n\n&quot;The Hanging Tree&quot; (Hensley, Jack Williams) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:40 \n&quot;Been Away Too Long&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:03 \n&quot;Who Needs Me&quot; (Kerslake) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:39 \n&quot;Wise Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:40 \n&quot;Do You Know&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:12 \n&quot;Rollin' On&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:21 \n&quot;Sympathy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44 \n&quot;Firefly&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:21 \nBonus tracks on expanded de-luxe edition from 2004\n&quot;Crime Of Passion&quot; (B-side) \n&quot;A Far Better Way&quot; (out-take) \n&quot;I Always Knew&quot; (out-take) \n&quot;Dance Dance Dance&quot; (out-take) \n&quot;Been Away Too Long&quot; (demo) \n&quot;Do You Know&quot; (demo) \n&quot;Who Needs Me&quot; (live version) \n&quot;Wise Man&quot; (TV Backing Track) \n[edit] Personnel\nJohn Lawton ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ lead vocals \nKen Hensley ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ keyboards, guitars, vocals \nMick Box ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitars \nTrevor Bolder ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass guitar \nLee Kerslake ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums, vocals \nEngineer - Peter Gallen \nAssisted by John Gallen \nCover concept and co-ordination - Gail Clarke \nCover painting - Martin White \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae86f4a48ae7e7e41cbb1e080acb4a5cd27d940c","amp;dn":"Uriah+Heep...Firefly%281977%29CD%282004%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae86f4a48ae7e7e41cbb1e080acb4a5cd27d940c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,134,244,164,138,231,231,228,28,187,30,8,10,203,74,92,210,125,148,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
