The more cocaine he snorts, the faster he sings, and the more disjointed and surreal the song becomes. Eventually the whole experience is revealed to be a vivid hallucination. Jorma Taccone, Alec Baldwin and Tom Petty make cameos.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d816809969f3021b8f9c4d66e76403825f30a61b","amp;dn":"Great+Day+-+SNL+-+AVI+and+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d816809969f3021b8f9c4d66e76403825f30a61b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,22,128,153,105,243,2,27,143,156,77,102,231,100,3,130,95,48,166,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
