ZyX and G-Collections.\n\nHow to install:\n\n1. Unpack with 7-zip/WinRAR to your game folder\nand rename or replace VOICE file (~435 Mb) with this one (~1.65 Gb).\n2. Run game.\n3. Ignore message (press &quot;Yes&quot; if you have this one):\n\nThere will be no voice or sound effects because the system does not support ADPCM files. Do you wish to continue? (CODE =0:0)\n\nVOICEs Must Be Heard!\n\n\n\n\nWARNING! If there is no sounds in the game menu (buttons click etc.) then this Voice Pack does NOT help you. Your system is truly hard to play PCM:(\nI try(ed) different versions of msadp32.acm 4.x 5.x 7.x on Win XP - it doesn't work on my system.
