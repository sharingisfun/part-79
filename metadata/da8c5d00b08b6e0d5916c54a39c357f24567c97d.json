It features interviews with two Freemasons and two researchers who are trying to understand what Freemasonry is all about. It's a short but interesting investigative video on what Masons are not telling us about their private club that is apparently not even a secret society anymore. Find out what they have to say about themselves. 15 min. long. A must see for everyone.\n\nVideo specs:\nVideo codec: xvid, 720x576, 1175 kbps\nAudio codec: MP3, 48kHz, Stereo\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da8c5d00b08b6e0d5916c54a39c357f24567c97d","amp;dn":"All+Hail+Supreme+Architect+of+Universe%28Freemasonry%29%28Richard+Kers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da8c5d00b08b6e0d5916c54a39c357f24567c97d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,140,93,0,176,139,110,13,89,22,197,74,57,195,87,242,69,103,201,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
