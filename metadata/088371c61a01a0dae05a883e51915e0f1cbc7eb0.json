Its construction was a monumental saga of perseverance, primal machines, convict labor and engineering brilliance. Keeping it up and running in the face of floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, and deadly landslides is an endless battle.\n\nMODERN MARVELSÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® puts the top down for a ride along the spectacular road, with diversions into its past and glimpses of the future. See how a revolutionary technology using molten zinc and electricity is giving aging bridges a new lease on life. Hear from a landslide expert about the ongoing fight to keep the road on stable ground. And scores of photos and rare footage capture the drama and ambition of the Herculean task that created the ultimate seaside drive.\n\nFormat : AVI\nLength : 348 MiB for 43mn 58s 772ms\nCodec : XviD\nsource : PDTV\n\nVideo #0 : MPEG-4 Visual at 962 Kbps\nAspect : 512 x 384 (1.333) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0 : MPEG Audio at 131 Kbps\nInfos : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:088371c61a01a0dae05a883e51915e0f1cbc7eb0","amp;dn":"History+-+Pacific+Coast+Highway+%282004%29+%5BPDTV%5D%7EEkolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"088371c61a01a0dae05a883e51915e0f1cbc7eb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,131,113,198,26,1,160,218,224,90,136,62,81,145,94,15,28,188,126,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
