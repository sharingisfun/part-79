It does not matter where you stand politically, left, right or center. That is irrelevant. \n\nThis documentary is only concerned with what is factual. The world we live in is now changing drastically faster and to the worse for the majority of people. \n\nUnfortunately most people are in a locked mainstream media transe and are generally oblivious to the realities around them. The saying goes; &quot;ignorance is bliss&quot;.. But today this is no longer valid, if it ever was.\n\n&quot;Ignorance is lethal&quot; is a more accurate description of our time. This production will touch upon familar topics for some of you, and for many of you, subjects that are more or less unknown. \n\nSome realities like for instance; worldwide airial spraying will most likely frighten most of you, and it should frighten most of you into action and disgust. Because of corrupted institutions and biased media today, citizen journalism is one of the most important factors in alerting your fellow human beings to the crimes against humanity. That is why this documentary came about.\n\nPlease copy and pass around this film to your friends and family. And remember to have an open mind. \n\nDVD 16:9 Aspect ratio. PAL System.\n\nProduction year: 2007/2008/2009.\n\nRunning time 190 min. \n\nTorrent Awake in the Dream - CD1: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5671655","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b5f44221a0d63ac40dad570eee9ee79a15137ed","amp;dn":"Awake+in+the+Dream+CD2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b5f44221a0d63ac40dad570eee9ee79a15137ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,95,68,34,26,13,99,172,64,218,213,112,238,233,238,121,161,81,55,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
