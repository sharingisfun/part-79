After\npicking up the guitar and realizing that he had a natural ability for writing\nsongs, he began working on his own material. With a need to be centre stage he\nbecame the front man for a few different pop punk bands and found something he\nwas truly passionate about. The more he played, the deeper his desire became, to\nmake music his career and to chase his dreams to wherever they might take him.\nContinuing to write and perform his own brand of folk/acoustic/pop-punk songs he\nfound his own consistent sound that was not achieved in any of the bands he was\napart of. Although he wrote most of his songs in his room with an acoustic\nguitar he still craved for that bigger sound and found himself picking up the\nelectric more and more. Once he had written a healthy collection of songs he\nbegan working on some demos at Music Centre Canada Recording Studios with\nproducer Daron Schofield. Soon the demos transformed into full production\nrecordings and Andrew found himself in the middle of Recording his debut Album\n&quot;Reckless Abandon&quot;. From the aggressive guitar hooks and catchy pop/punk vocal\nmelodies on his lead out single, &quot;The End&quot;, to the soulful musings and haunting\nguitar lines on the social conscious track, &quot;So Small&quot;, you will find &quot;Reckless\nAbandon&quot; to be a very diverse album with something for everyone. At the age of\n17 he is able to eloquently express his life experience through his\nlyrics......you will find a depth beyond his years and a connection with his\nhonesty.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e0bb873213e05d6533f59897d0441fc31620406","amp;dn":"Andrew_F-Reckless_Abandon-2008-RTB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e0bb873213e05d6533f59897d0441fc31620406","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,11,184,115,33,62,5,214,83,63,89,137,125,4,65,252,49,98,4,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
