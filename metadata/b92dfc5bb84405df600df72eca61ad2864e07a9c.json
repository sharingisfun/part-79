Due to being lit for the concert stage and not for the cameras some shots are darker than others but overall it's an accurate reproduction of the source material.  On the other hand the performance is marvelous.  Includes a basic menu for selecting individual songs.  Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b92dfc5bb84405df600df72eca61ad2864e07a9c","amp;dn":"Paul+McCartney+%26+Wings+-+Rockshow++%28Laserdisc+rip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b92dfc5bb84405df600df72eca61ad2864e07a9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,45,252,91,184,68,5,223,96,13,247,46,202,97,173,40,100,224,122,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
