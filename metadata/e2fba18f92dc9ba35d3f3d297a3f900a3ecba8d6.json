The security wall being constructed by Israel on the West Bank has divided Palestinian families and communities. It has also isolated the Catholic-run Our Lady of Sorrows nursing home outside of Jerusalem, leaving its feisty residents to face old age in the throes of one of the world's most bitter conflicts. With beautiful imagery, moments of laughter and use of a quietly eccentric older guide, This Way Up examines the social, economic and religious barriers that arise from physical ones.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 56mn 23s 83ms\nCodec             : XviD\nsource            : PDTV\nSubtitles         : English\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 009 Kbps\nAspect            : 528 x 384 (1.375) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 130 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2fba18f92dc9ba35d3f3d297a3f900a3ecba8d6","amp;dn":"PBS+POV+-+This+Way+Up.08.25.2009.PDTV.XviD%7EEkolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2fba18f92dc9ba35d3f3d297a3f900a3ecba8d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,251,161,143,146,220,155,163,93,63,61,41,122,63,144,10,62,203,168,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
