I have always used this on every machine i have had. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!)\n\n\nIt's hard to stand out in the crowded field of defraggers, but SmartDefrag is able to do so with an unexpected twist.\n\nAlong with quick analysis and scans, SmartDefrag boasts an automated defragger that continually defrags the files that you use the most, and does it without becoming a persistent drag on your system resources. When running in the background, the program only eats up 14MB of RAM, so it's possible to run it smoothly on older machines.\n\nOther features we like include a scheduler you can set up to defrag whenever you want and some customization features if you want the program to start when Windows loads or right before logging off. You also can set it to shutdown your computer when it's done defragging your hard drives and partitions.\n\nOverall, if you would like a handy defragger with options for scheduling and more, this is a great defragger for both novices and more experienced users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem with the torrent?
