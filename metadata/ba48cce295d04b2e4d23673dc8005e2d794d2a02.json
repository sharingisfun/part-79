Best-known for playing quiet, understated characters who use violence when pushed too far, \n\nGary Cooper gets the opportunity to explore a more peaceful resolution -- though the film occasionally suggests that no person \n\ncan be completely pacifistic. The tech credits are solid, as should be expected for a film directed by William Wyler; of \n\nparticular note are Dimitri Tiomkin's score and Dorothy Jeakins's costume design. Though the film tends to exaggerate Quaker \n\nspeech, the performances are convincing, and the screenplay (by blacklisted Michael Wilson) does a good job of transferring \n\nJessamyn West's story to the screen. The film received six Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, though it did not win in \n\nany category. ~ Richard Gilliam, All Movie Guide\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
