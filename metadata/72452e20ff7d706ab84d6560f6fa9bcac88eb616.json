In 1999 the Independent record label, K Records, released The Gossip's first recording, their eponymous debut EP, The Gossip.\n\nTheir next release was their first album That's Not What I Heard and was released by the record label Kill Rock Stars on January 23, 2001. In between the release of their second album, they released the EP Arkansas Heat on May 7, 2002. Movement, the group's second studio album, followed one year later and was released on May 6, 2003. In November 2003, two months after the release of their first live album Undead in NYC on September 9, drummer Kathy Mendonca left the band to pursue a career as a midwife. Established punk drummer Hannah Blilie joined to replace her. In 2005, the band performed at North East Sticks Together.\n\nThe first release featuring new drummer Hannah Blilie was the band's next album Standing in the Way of Control. It was released on January 24, 2006 on Kill Rock Stars and later on in 2006 on UK independent label Back Yard Recordings.\n\n\nLive in Italy September 2009.\n\n\n.ooOO ROSA MANNEN 2009 OOoo.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RosaMannen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RosaMannen&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72452e20ff7d706ab84d6560f6fa9bcac88eb616","amp;dn":"Gossip+-+Standing+In+The+Way+Of+Control+%28Live+Porto+Antico+Genoa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72452e20ff7d706ab84d6560f6fa9bcac88eb616","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,69,46,32,255,125,112,106,184,77,101,96,246,250,155,202,200,142,182,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
