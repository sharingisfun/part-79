Slow moving, but provocative and also can be referred to as a &quot;thinking audience's&quot; movie, which is good. The ending was rather flat, because it failed to tie everything together and that was disappointing.\n\nTeen's will be teens and that's how they were portrayed (obviously). The storyline was great, but could have been better presented for the screen. &quot;Paranoid Park&quot; does do a good job of teaching the lesson about, what happens when you get into trouble and don't do anything (the guilt racks up immensely). This is still a good movie for teens and adults to watch (even together).
