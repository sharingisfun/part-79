Now The History of Love proves Krauss is among our finest and freshest literary voices.\n\nIt has been decades since Leo Gursky first surrendered his heart, then wrote a book about it, at the tender age of 10, and he's been in love with the same person ever since. Leo believes his book is lost to time, but what he doesn't know is, not only has it survived 60 years without him, it has also been an inspiration to others. Fourteen-year-old Alma was even named for a character from the book. When she realizes how deeply the story touched her lonely mother, she embarks on a search for answers.\n\nThe History of Love is an imaginative tale of love and loss that is at once funny, mysterious, and deeply passionate.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d522eb11077d7b138e2da3f421ddb2dfd08d637","amp;dn":"The+History+of+Love+%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d522eb11077d7b138e2da3f421ddb2dfd08d637","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,82,46,177,16,119,215,177,56,226,218,63,66,29,219,45,253,8,214,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
