We improved the frame rate a great deal in this release. Some \npeople have reported as much as a 40% increase - although performance varies \nbased upon your specific system setup. \n\n-Instant Action- \nThe new Instant Action mode of AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Army allows you to quickly jump into \nthe AA action without the need to complete training first. Now with Instant \nAction Recruit status you can play alongside veteran AA gamers and complete \ntraining at your convenience. Instant Action is available on any mission that \nis not restricted to Special Forces only players. You will need to complete \nBasic Combat Training in order to achieve honor levels higher than Honor 20, \nplus you'll gain the benefits of improving your skills as a soldier with each \ntraining level you complete! Your Honor will remain at 20 until you pass BCT, at \nwhich point you will receive all of the additional experience points you have \naccrued. \n\n-AA Loader- \nThe new AA Loader checks your version of the game to ensure you are up to date \nwith the most current release. It also provides easy links to other community \ntools and support information. The AA Loader requires Internet Explorer 6.0 or \nlater be installed on your system. \n\n-Flashbang- \nThe flashbang has been tuned a bit to make it more realistic. The effectiveness \nhas been reduced when used outdoors. Also the blackout duration has been \nreduced. \n\n-Weapon Reloading- \nWeapons reload faster then before. Fixing jams and using the \nsupported/unsupported function are also quicker now. \n\n-Every Soldier is a Sensor (ES2)- \nEvery Soldier, as a part of a small unit, is a potential information collector \nand an essential component in achieving situational awareness. The updated \nSF Extraction mission includes new ES2 gameplay designed to embrace this \nnew ES2 philosophy. \n\n-SAI Creation Tool- \nThe AA Mission Editor now includes tools to help you set up and capture images \nfor use with the Situational Awareness Indicator (SAI). You can customize \nthe captured images and import them into your maps to enable simple SAI \nfunctionality. Look in the 'Tools/SAI Map Image Tools' menu to give it a try. \n\nSystem Requirements (have not changed) \n============================================= \nThe current Minimum System Requirements for AA:SF (Overmatch) are as follows: \n\n* 3-D graphics card with 128 MB memory and support for hardware transformation and lighting \n* 1.8 GHz processor or equivalent \n* English version of Windows(r) 2000/XP Operating System with latest updates \n* 512 MB RAM \n* 3.5GB of uncompressed hard disk space for game files \n* 4X DVD-ROM (not required for downloaded installations) \n* Windows 2000/XP compatible system \n* DirectX(r)9.0 \n* 100% Compatible DirectX 9.0 soundcard \n* 56kbps Modem or other network connection \n* *NvidiaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® nForceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ or other motherboard/soundcards containing Dolby DigitalÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Content Encoder \nrequired for Dolby DigitalÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® audio. \n\n\nThe current Recommended System Requirements for AA:SF (Overmatch) are as follows: \n\n* 3-D graphics card with 256 MB memory and support for hardware transformation and lighting \n* 3.0 GHz processor or equivalent \n* English version of Windows(r) 2000/XP Operating System with all updates \n* 1 GB RAM \n* 3.5GB of uncompressed hard disk space for game files \n* 4X DVD-ROM (not required for downloaded installation) \n* Windows 2000/XP compatible system \n* 100% Compatible DirectX 9.0 soundcard \n* Broadband Network Connection \n* *NvidiaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® nForceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ or other motherboard/soundcards containing Dolby DigitalÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Content Encoder \nrequired for Dolby DigitalÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® audio. \n\n\nTechnical Notes \n============================================= \nImportant Note for Server Hosts/Admins \nThe cooperative missions will take significantly more CPU resources to run during normal gameplay due \nto the additional AI processing load (shared between the server &amp; client). Server hosts planning to \nrun Co-Op servers should plan accordingly. In addition, players running a Co-Op server and client on \nthe same machine will experience heavy CPU demand. \n\nIt is recommended that server rotations switch only from Co-Op level to Co-Op level, or MP to MP level \nfor best performance. \n\n\nGame Ports \n============================================= \nThe internet ports currently required to be open for America's Army v2.8.2 are listed below: \n\nUDP - 1716, 1717, 1718, 8777, 27900 \nTCP - 14200, 20025-45, 20046, 20047, 20048, 28910 \n\nUDP ports explained: \n1716 for the Game, \n1717 for the GameQuery, \n1718 for the Master Server Query, \n8777 for the Standard UT Query, and 27900 for GameSpy. \n\nTCP ports explained: \n28910 for GameSpy \n20025-45 for MBS Game Server, \n20046 for the Auth server, \n20047 for MBS, 20048 for DCDS, and 14200 for LAN. \n\n\nWhat's Fixed \n============================================= \n\nNOTE: This list only includes bugs present in v2.8.2 that have been fixed. \nBug fixes related to new v2.8.2 features and certain security/exploit fixes have been removed from \nthis list. \n\n\nBugs Fixed \n- Demorec: Demorec system does not save files to the correct directory \n- Demo Mode: There are no sounds from the pawns weapon when he is firing it. \n- Shoothouse Map: Wrong m9 ammo is shown on the table \n- Demo Mode: Muzzle flashes are not displayed on playback. \n- SF Water Treatment Map: Player is able to shoot through bulletproof glass in Machinery Server Room \n- Gameplay: Screen shaking is observed when player joins map and changes viewpoints \n- Medic Field: Cap rank does not match rank on ACU Shirt \n- Weapons: Obtaining 31 40MM rounds with the M203 causes the rifle to malfunction. \n- GamePlay: Player observes camera shaking while dying. \n- Steamroller Map: Objective shows up through concrete wall \n- Hospital Map: Smoke grenade is eaten by truck. \n- Guildhall SF Refinery - Reporting in Northwest &amp;
