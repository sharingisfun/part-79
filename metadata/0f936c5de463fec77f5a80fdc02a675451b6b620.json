Hoagland\n\nInvestigative reporter Linda Moulton Howe presented more military eyewitness accounts of the RAF Bentwaters/Rendlesham Forest UFO case that involved highly strange aerial lights and unknown craft sightings that took place over the span of December 26-28, 1980 (on the 8/27/09 show, she interviewed Col. Charles Halt and UK researcher Gary Heseltine about the case). She talked to RAF Bentwaters security man, Richard Bertolino, who was coming forward for the first time. He described a football-field-sized globe of eerie white light over part of the forest while he was on the radio with Staff Sgt. Jim Penniston who was investigating the Rendlesham lights the night of Dec. 26, 1980.\n\nPenniston also spoke with Linda, and described the extraordinary triangular craft they encountered on the forest floor which appeared as solid black glass emanating periodic circles of red, orange and blue light on its surface. He said he dragged his hand along the smooth, glassy surface and confirmed that symbols on the craft were not engraved, but &quot;felt like sandpaper amid the glassy surface.&quot; He further reported an unexplained 45-minute period of missing time. Airman 1st Class John Burroughs, a USAF police officer who accompanied Penniston, is seeking to recall events through hypnosis sessions, and is also trying to organize a reunion for Bentwaters personnel who were at the base during the 1980 event.\n\nShe noted that UFO phenomena at Bentwaters/Rendlesham Forest didn't end on Dec. 28, 1980. 12 days later on Jan. 9, 1981 RAF Bentwaters Airman 1st Class Steve LaPlume and his military security colleague, Wendelle Palmer, saw an aerial light moving up and down in a sine wave motion, followed by the appearance of a huge cylindrical-shaped aerial craft that was the size of a football field. For further details on Linda's investigation into the Bentwaters case, see her reports Part 1 &amp; Part 2, and related article 1 and article 2.\nWater on the Moon\n\nFirst hour guest, C2C Science Advisor Richard C. Hoagland talked about findings that confirm water on the moon. Such water is manufactured by the action of solar winds, he suggested. He further postulated that buried lunar ruins and structures were leaking water vapor out, which was rising to the moon's surface through fissures and cracks.\n\nWebsite(s):\nearthfiles.com\nenterprisemission.com\ndarkmission.net\n\nBook(s):\nMysterious Lights and Crop Circles\nGlimpses of Other Realities, Volume 2\nDark Mission\n\n\n\nbrought to you by:\n                                                \n .d8888b.                                                      888    \nd88P  Y88b                                                     888    \n888    888                                                     888    \n888    888 888  888  .d88b.  888d888 .d8888b  8888b.  .d8888b  888888 \n888    888 888  888 d8P  Y8b 888P&quot;  d88P&quot;        &quot;88b 88K      888    \n888    888 Y88  88P 88888888 888    888      .d888888 &quot;Y8888b. 888    \nY88b  d88P  Y8bd8P  Y8b.     888    Y88b.    888  888      X88 Y88b.  \n &quot;Y8888P&quot;    Y88P    &quot;Y8888  888     &quot;Y8888P &quot;Y888888  88888P'  &quot;Y888 \n\nTorrents: http://thepiratebay.se/user/0vercast/\nRSS: http://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/2eb7e342dacfa8938e79732ad03e1224","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f936c5de463fec77f5a80fdc02a675451b6b620","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+AM+-+Sep+24+2009+-+Bentwaters+UFO+Case","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f936c5de463fec77f5a80fdc02a675451b6b620","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,147,108,93,228,99,254,199,127,90,128,253,192,42,103,84,81,182,182,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
