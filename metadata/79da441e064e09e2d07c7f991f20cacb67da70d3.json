And if you could, Pixie certainly wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have picked Mastermind, the man who turned Jean Grey into the Dark Phoenix. But right now, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the least of her problems. A giant demon named Saturnine has been using her Pixie dust to lull her fellow X-Men into submission and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s worked. Now heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s one step away from all the power he needs to take control of the world. Can the fast-talking Welsh girl with wings possibly stop him?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79da441e064e09e2d07c7f991f20cacb67da70d3","amp;dn":"X-Men+-+Pixie+Strikes+Back+04+%28of+04%29+%282010%29+%28Minutemen-DTs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79da441e064e09e2d07c7f991f20cacb67da70d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,218,68,30,6,78,9,226,208,124,127,153,31,32,202,203,103,218,112,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
