Growing up in the shadow of the brilliant barrister, who adored his garden and hated visitors, and whose blindness was never mentioned, the son continually yearns for his father's love and respect.\n\nA radio production of John Mortimer's highly acclaimed West End play with the 2006 theatre cast.\n\nOne episode of approximately 90 minutes.\n\nTheatre Reviews:\n`This is John Mortimer's best play, a play hilariously and profoundly English, so profoundly as to be universal... Thea Sharrock's production is spare, precise and moving: the actors play together like an orchestra of minds... Derek Jacobi creates... a masterful performance, towering, touching and tragic: one of the great events of the year.` [The Sunday Times]\n\n`An evening of rare and continuous pleasure`\n[Daily Telegraph]\n\n`Thea Sharrock's beautifully pitched and acted production...AN UNMISSABLE COMIC TRIP`\n[Evening Standard]\n\n\n\nWith:\nFather.........Derek Jacobi\nMother.........Joanna David\nThe Son........Dominic Rowan\nThe Boy........Angus Imrie\nElizabeth......Natasha Little\nHeadmaster.....Christopher Benjamin\nHam............Osmund Bullock\nReigate........Dominic Curran\nMiss Cox.......Lil Bevan\nMiss Baker.....Sadie Shimmin\nMr Thong.......Neil Boorman\nSparks.........Jamie de Courcey\n\nDirector:\nThea Sharrock\n\n\nType : mpeg 1 layer III\nBitrate : 128\nMode : joint stereo\nFrequency : 44100 Hz\nEncoder : Lame 3.95\nSize: 80 MB\n\n\nRipped from the audio torrent site radioarchive.cc - Registration is FREE!!\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86149f6e17f2becb5136674c01b5da3572f33fed","amp;dn":"A+Voyage+Round+My+Father+-+John+Mortimer++%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86149f6e17f2becb5136674c01b5da3572f33fed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,20,159,110,23,242,190,203,81,54,103,76,1,181,218,53,114,243,63,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
