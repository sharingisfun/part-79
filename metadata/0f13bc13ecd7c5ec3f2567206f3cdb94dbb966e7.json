In each episode the WotWots help children to celebrate and understand the diversity of the animal world. They recognise kindness and co-operation as core values, delight in learning new words and enjoy exploring their creativity through drawing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f13bc13ecd7c5ec3f2567206f3cdb94dbb966e7","amp;dn":"The+WotWots+-+Lumpy+Bumpies_%5B720x404%5D.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f13bc13ecd7c5ec3f2567206f3cdb94dbb966e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,19,188,19,236,215,197,236,63,37,103,32,111,60,219,148,219,185,102,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
