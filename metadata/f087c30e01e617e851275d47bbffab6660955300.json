Rose In The Dark                7:33\n2. Arrival                         5:55\n3. Touching Go                     5:16\n4. Rise                            5:39\n5. Down Of The Sun                 5:16\n6. In This World                   5:28\n7. Generation Next                 3:31\n8. Nevermore                       6:37\n9. Voice In The Silence            4:55\n10.The Chain                       4:18\n\n\n\nJudas Priest, Helstar, Vicious Rumours and Wolf. Try to imagine whatever\nassociations these names stir in you with a female vocalist. Unusual as it may\nsound at first, it's exactly what exceptional vocalist London Wilde and Dave\nStarr, wellknown for his bass-work in the aforementioned Vicious Rumours as well\nas Laaz Rockit, Destillery and Chastain, do.\n\nOf course pure and uncontaminated US power metal is the name of the game and Mr.\nStarr knows how to play it. Riff after powerful riff is blown on to the listener\nwhile Wilde's shrieks soar overhead, overshadowing most male heavy metal singers\nin the process. For connoisseurs of the genre it soon becomes obvious that the\nduo has created a few really exceptional songs. There however also lies the rub.\nWhile some tracks are close to heavy metal masterpieces, a few others are\ncompletely forgettable altogether. To be blunt, the slightly balladesque moments\nof the album bore me and while there are many amazing riffs on it, a fair amount\nof filler-riffs have found their way on it as well.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f087c30e01e617e851275d47bbffab6660955300","amp;dn":"Wildestarr-Arrival-2009-SSR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f087c30e01e617e851275d47bbffab6660955300","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,135,195,14,1,230,23,232,81,39,93,71,187,255,171,102,96,149,83,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
