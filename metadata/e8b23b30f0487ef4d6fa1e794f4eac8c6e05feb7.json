Their vocals were handled by principal singer-songwriter Roger Salloom and the more distinctive, often keeningly high tones of Robin Sinclair, whose style was at times reminiscent of that of Janis Joplin, though sometimes she went into an astronomically high range. Their sole, self-titled album was produced by Marshall Chess on the Chess subsidiary Cadet Concept. Slightly later, Salloom and Sinclair, as the hyphenated duo Salloom-Sinclair, released an album on Cadet Concept in 1969 produced by esteemed Nashville session man Charlie McCoy. ~ Richie Unterberger, All Music Guide\n\nRecorded at Ter Mar Studios, Chicago, July 1968\n\nTracks:\n\nA-side:\n01.
