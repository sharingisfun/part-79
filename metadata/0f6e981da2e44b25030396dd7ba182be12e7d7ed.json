Roberto (Ernesto Alterio) was born in Buenos Aires, but has been away for close to 30 years when he finds himself back home to visit the father he feels be barely knows after the man falls into a coma. Waiting for his hotel room to be ready, Roberto is walking in the rain that has been falling on the city for three days straight when a woman named Alma (Valeria Bertuccelli) opens the door to her car and he impulsively hops in. Alma feels almost as lost in the city as Roberto; her nine-year relationship with her boyfriend ended abruptly a few days before, and having been tossed out of his apartment, she's been living out of her car and looking for a new place to call home. Fate brings these two lost souls together, but where will it lead them?\n\n\nFile Name .........................................: Lluvia.2008.DVD-RIP.XVID.MP3.CLAN-SUD.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 733,050,880 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:45:59\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 544x304 (AR: 1.789)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 797 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.201 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 112 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
