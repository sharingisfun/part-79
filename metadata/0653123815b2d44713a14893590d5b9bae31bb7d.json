The song is heavily influenced by the Jamaican dancehall music present at No Doubt's post-show parties and tour bus lounges of their Return of Saturn tour. Its lyrics describe the debauchery with groupies at these parties.\n\nThe song received positive reviews from music critics, though the song's dancehall influences had a mixed reception. It was released as the album's lead single in October 2001. The single was commercially successful and peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100. At the 45th Grammy Awards, &quot;Hey Baby&quot; won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.\n\nThe song's music video, directed by Dave Meyers, follows the theme of the lyrics. It shows the band on a tour bus, stopping at a party at Club Poonani. The members separate when three girls approach the male band members. Kanal has his picture taken with several women, paying for it by taking money that drummer Adrian Young earns by hanging from gymnastics rings naked. Dumont defeats a woman, portrayed by Sonya Eddy, in an endurance drinking game, and Stefani dances, eventually joining Bounty Killer on stage. There are intercut scenes of the band members on a red and black background, a black and white houndstooth background, and standing on top of the phrases &quot;NO DOUBT&quot;, &quot;ROCK STEADY&quot;, and &quot;HEY BABY&quot; in red and white.\n\nThe video was filmed in three days in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles. The scenes were designed to recreate the parties that the band attended while recording Rock Steady in Jamaica. Young's scene was based on an actual event, where he won US$200 on a dare to hang upside down and naked on the rings at a club in New York. Dumont's scene, filmed at Casa Mexicana, is inspired by a similar scene from the 1981 Indiana Jones film Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n\nYoung's full frontal on the rings, shown during Bounty Killer's line &quot;The way you rock your hips, you know that it amaze me,&quot; was controversial. The scene was mocked by the homophobic dancehall community in Jamaica, where sex between men is illegal. Bounty Killer's rival Beenie Man stated that &quot;the video portray Bounty as a gay. That is a Jamaican artist, and that can't gwan in a dancehall, no way.&quot; Bounty Killer cancelled his performances with No Doubt because of the incident, stating that &quot;they did not understand because they are from America and they accept gay people ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ If Jamaica is upset, I ain't going to accept no success that my culture is not proud of.&quot;\n\nThe video proved to be successful. It debuted at number ten on MTV's Total Request Live, peaking at number three, and topped VH1's Top 20 Countdown for three weeks. The video won the MTV Video Music Awards for Best Pop Video and Best Group Video in 2002. In Canada, it reached number eight on MuchMusic's Countdown for two consecutive weeks and remained on the countdown for nine weeks. The video was nominated for Best International Group Video at the 2002 MuchMusic Video Awards but lost to Korn's &quot;Here to Stay&quot;.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt; \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0653123815b2d44713a14893590d5b9bae31bb7d","amp;dn":"No+Doubt+-+Hey+Baby","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0653123815b2d44713a14893590d5b9bae31bb7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,83,18,56,21,178,212,71,19,161,72,147,89,13,91,155,174,49,187,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
