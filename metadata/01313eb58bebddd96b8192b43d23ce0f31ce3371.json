It premiered on October 23, 2009. In December 2009, White Collar was renewed for a second season beginning on July 13, 2010; USA Network did not announce the number of episodes ordered. Neal Caffrey, a con-man, forger and thief, is captured after a three-year game of cat and mouse with the FBI. With three months left while serving a four-year sentence, he escapes from a maximum-security federal prison to find Kate, his ex-girlfriend. Peter Burke, the FBI agent who initially captured Caffrey, finds him at a dead end in his search and returns Caffrey to prison. This time, Caffrey gives Burke information about evidence in another case; however, this information comes with a price: Burke must have a meeting with Caffrey. At this meeting, Caffrey proposes a deal: he will help Burke catch other criminals as part of a work-release program. Burke agrees, after some hesitation. Through the successful apprehending of several white-collar criminals, Caffrey has proven to Burke that he will help him, and that he will not try to escape again. This begins an unconventional, but successful partnership.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01313eb58bebddd96b8192b43d23ce0f31ce3371","amp;dn":"White+Collar+Complete+Season+1+%28DL_King%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01313eb58bebddd96b8192b43d23ce0f31ce3371","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,49,62,181,139,235,221,217,107,129,146,180,61,35,206,15,49,206,51,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
