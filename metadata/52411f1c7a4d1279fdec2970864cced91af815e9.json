Clair, and Stephen King lend their voices as newscasters on the radio.[6] Shawn Roberts also appeared in Land of the Dead, making him the tenth actor to appear in at least two of Romero's zombie films, after Simon Pegg, Joseph Pilato, Tom Savini, Gregory Nicotero, Boyd Banks, John Amplas, Alan van Sprang, Taso N. Stavrakis and Romero himself. Of the aforementioned ten, Romero and Nicotero have made appearances in three films, with Alan van Sprang set to join them upon the release of the next installment, Survival of the Dead.\n\nPlot\n\nThe movie begins with an introduction to a documentary called The Death of Death. The movie then shows a view from a cameraman and a news reporter, reporting on a murder of a local family. The reporter and newswoman chat while the ambulance crew load the deceased bodies. Suddenly, one of the bodies moves and an ambulance worker attempts to resuscitate the person when they are bitten. Another zombie approaches the news crew and police open fire on them but are ineffective at killing the zombies. The news lady is bitten on the neck while the cameraman films. The scene cuts to a group of young film studies students from the University of Pittsburgh who are in the woods making their own horror film about a mummy along with their faculty advisor, when they hear on the radio the news of apparent mass-rioting and mass murder. Soon, these reports include cannibalism and the fact that the recently deceased are inexplicably awaking and walking.\n\nRidley and Francine decide to leave the group, while Jason, who wants to film the events documentary-style, heads to the dormitory of his girlfriend Debra Monahan. She does not succeed in contacting her family and they travel in Mary's RV to the house of Debra's parents in Scranton, Pennsylvania. While driving her RV, Mary sees a car accident and runs over a highway patrolman and three other zombies trying to escape from them. Thereafter, the group stops and the apparently despondent Mary tries to commit suicide, shooting herself in the head with a pistol. Her friends take her to a hospital where they realize that the dead are indeed awaking and walking and they need to fight to survive while traveling to Debra's parents' house. On their way the RV suffers damage, the fuel line is cut. They are assisted by an Amish man named Samuel who can't hear but only reads lips. While repairing the RV, the Amish man's barn is swarmed by zombies. Just before escaping Samuel is bitten. He takes his own life by stabbing himself with a scythe through his head, with the blade also running through the zombie's head. They later pass a city and are stopped by an armed gang. They try to barter with the men, who are better armed and supplied. The men are survivors of the attack on their city; everyone else left. The leader is a member of the National Guard, and doesn't believe the military will help. They rest in the city for a while, and edit their videos. There is a small argument amongst Jason and Debra, who doesn't share his belief in the need for videos. Jason sees the recordings as a necessity to show the world what was really happening. His uploaded videos reach 72,000 hits in eight minutes. They also find out that Debra's family was camping for the extent of the crisis, and is just now on their way home. The National Guard survivors gear up after one of their members had a heart attack and dies, then goes missing. They mistakenly kill one of their own and the chase the zombie into the fuel supply area. He is killed when a container full of hydrochloric acid is smashed on his head and it dissolves in front of the whole group. The students resupply and leave for Debra's house. They get a video stream from Tokyo from a survivor until they lose signal. The radio towers have become unreliable. The only dependable source of information is from the internet, added by bloggers and the like.\n\nWhen they arrive at Debra's house they first believe that the family is not there yet. Upon further inspection they find that Debra's family have died and become zombies. Debra's brother jumps on her and is shot in the head by the teacher, with a recently acquired bow. Debra's mother is shot after rising from behind a couch feeding on a hand what is most likely from Debra's father. They escape the house and decide to travel back to Ridley's mansion. Members of the real National Guard stop and rob them. The leader of the unit enters the RV and forces Jason at point blank to turn off his camera while they rob the RV. They steal all but the weapons (the bow and a shotgun) and run off shooting their rifles in the air.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848557/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848557/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPLEASE SEED AND ENJOY THANKS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52411f1c7a4d1279fdec2970864cced91af815e9","amp;dn":"DIARY-of-the-DEAD..DVDrip%5Bvice%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52411f1c7a4d1279fdec2970864cced91af815e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,65,31,28,122,77,18,121,253,236,41,112,134,76,206,217,26,248,21,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
