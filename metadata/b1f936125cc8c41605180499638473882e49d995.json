National Geographic has supported the research of the worlds top blue whale scientist for years. Now, by working with them, we go on a mission around the globe. We dive deep under the surface with blue whales to discover what they do at depth. We use satellite tags to reveal their mammoth migrations.We identify individual whales to understand populations. DNA analysis reveals gender related behavioral differences.\n\n\n\nWe explore the sea floor and water currents to uncover blue whale feeding strategies. Hydro acoustic microphones reveal whale song and whole dialects in blue whale communication. Ultimately we follow the California population of blue whales to a remote area of open ocean off Costa Rica . If we and our scientists are right, we will reveal the secret calving and breeding grounds of blue whales. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrator: Tom Selleck\n---------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nProduced &amp; written by:  Sue Houghton\n-------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle: Kingdom Of The Blue Whale\nYear: 2009\nFile Size: 699 MB\nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 01:36:12\nVideo Codec: XviD \nVideo Resolution: 640x352\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1017 kbit/s\nDisplay Aspect ratio: 16/9\nFPS: 29.970000\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: MPEG Layer-3\nChannels: 2\nSubtitles: (N/A)\n\n\n\n \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1403075/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1403075/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at   \n\nthis link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         **** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ****\n\n\n\n\n\n###################################################################################\n#                                                                                 #\n# SPECIAL NOTE: Now with very fast downloads speeds people so you can enjoy all   #\n#               my documentaries.If you want any of my old documentaries to be    #\n#               seeded,post on my latest upload and you will have it in notime.   #\n###################################################################################\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPS: Remember to seed back at least what you have downloaded.After all it is free.Thank you.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1f936125cc8c41605180499638473882e49d995","amp;dn":"Kingdom+Of+The+Blue+Whale-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1f936125cc8c41605180499638473882e49d995","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,249,54,18,92,200,196,22,5,24,4,153,99,132,115,136,46,73,217,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
