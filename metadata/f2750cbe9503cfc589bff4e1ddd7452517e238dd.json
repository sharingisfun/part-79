I recommend \n      and use one system for years - CoreCodec for H264 and part of DivX7 for AAC. \n      Both are proved perfect, fastest and provide seamless playback up to 1080p \n      on new generation of computers. Newer NVIDIA graphic CPU decode H264 \n      using dedicated subroutines directly served from CoreCodec (I have ATI card, \n      just in case you've asked yourself).\n      \n      Any problems one can have come from wrong playback system, malfunctioning \n      device or lack of knowledge. \n      For instance, any so called &quot;jerky&quot; playback of &quot;system-heavy&quot; 720p comes\n      from insufficient CPU and graphic engine power or simply - overloaded \n      computer. Use of ddshow filters and &quot;codecs&quot; is suicidal. This is not \n      Russian 720p Matroska format (&quot;official&quot; 720p) and completely different \n      setup is required (extremely high bit-rates of .mkv 720p to some extension\n      &quot;hide&quot; bad encoding style). In low bit-rate H264, such as mine, \n      those errors and bad technique cannot be hidden and therefore are avoided as \n      much is possible.\n        \n      Any blurriness of video comes from less-than-recommended media player. VLC \n      and few other players are most versatile and good - but quality is 10-20%\n      lower.\n      Any block-ness comes from &quot;system-too-slow&quot; situation, when decoding engine \n      of one's device become over-capacitated and cannot process all frames as it \n      supposed.\n      On &quot;I have no video&quot; and &quot;I have no sound&quot; I don't waste my time.\n\n      MP4 is absolutely ISO 14496-1 compliant. There is no B-frames, no CABAC\n      entropy in 272p and 360p, no strange filtering and no AV weirdness \n      of any kind.\n\n      Recommended resolution for computers is 1024x768 (no matter frame-size).\n      PS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.\n      I am very proud on sound quality and hence I recommend use of stereo system \n      and proper loudspeakers (connect Line Out of Soundcard or standalones \n      with Line In of any Stereo rack).\n      \n      I encode H264 for six years and I have experienced (first-hand) any problem \n      one might have or imagine. I have heard almost every ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“complaintÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ out there \n      and would, if asked POLITELY, be happy to answer questions and give as much \n      help as humanly possible   \n      I always have.\n   \n      \nNOTE 2.: For people on slower connection and with slow or inappropriate hardware\n         (read about in Description of 272p Lost) I suggest 272p version \n         upped this morning.\n        &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5585784/Lost.S06E17-E18.272p.HDTV.H264&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5585784/Lost.S06E17-E18.272p.HDTV.H264&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2750cbe9503cfc589bff4e1ddd7452517e238dd","amp;dn":"Lost.S06E17-E18.720p.HDTV.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2750cbe9503cfc589bff4e1ddd7452517e238dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,117,12,190,149,3,207,197,137,191,244,225,221,215,69,37,23,226,56,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
