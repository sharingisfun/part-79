The video consists of Cosgrove on the beach singing and walking to meet her love interest, who is a sidewalk artist.

Later they are seen at a party where it seems they kiss. When she wakes up that morning she looks out the window to see a drawing of a butterfly with images of her and him in the wings on the sidewalk.
