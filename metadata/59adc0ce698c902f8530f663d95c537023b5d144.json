Tomorrow It's You is a stylishly filmed and straightforwardly told revenge story inspired by Samurai films and made by a director who had formerly produced well respected Italian film classics by directors like Fellini, Antonioni or Rosi. Brett Halsey in the lead, comes closer to the Django character than most of the &quot;official&quot; Django movies, and is just like the rest of his &quot;magnificient 5&quot; and his foe Tatsuya Nakadai, being characterized by his clothes and his behaviour, not by a background story or meaningful dialogue. The only blemish is that the big finale fails to set a real point of culmination for the film. But it is beautifully filmed in an enchanted looking autumnal wood.\n\nScreens: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MAdBlaaCk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MAdBlaaCk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/mADBpaack&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/mADBpaack&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/NadBBaACk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/NadBBaACk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/nadbEaAck&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/nadbEaAck&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/NAdbhaack&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/NAdbhaack&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrailer @ Utube  \n\n\n~~ My Rip ~~\n\nFile Name:..........
