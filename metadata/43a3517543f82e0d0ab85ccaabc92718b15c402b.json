Andy asks Pod for his thoughts and opinions along the way.\n\n\n\n(( You don't need to be a Cricket fan to enjoy this ))\n\n\n\n\nCast:\nDave Podmore....Christopher Douglas \nAndy Hamer....Andrew Nickolds \n\nNicola Sanderson\nLewis Macleod\nChris Pavlo\nEwan Bailey\nNick Newman\nRory Mcgrath\nSimon Greenall\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/dave_podmore/episodes/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/dave_podmore/episodes/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDave Podmore's - Cricket Fix - S01 - E01\nDave Podmore's - Cricket Fix - S01 - E02\nDave Podmore's - Cricket Fix - S01 - E03\nDave Podmore's - Cricket Fix - S01 - E04\n\nDave Podmore's - World Of Cricket - S01 - E01\nDave Podmore's - World Of Cricket - S01 - E02\nDave Podmore's - World Of Cricket - S01 - E03\nDave Podmore's - World Of Cricket - S01 - E04\n\nDave Podmore's - Cricket Night - S01 - E01\nDave Podmore's - Cricket Night - S01 - E02\nDave Podmore's - Cricket Night - S01 - E03\nDave Podmore's - Cricket Night - S01 - E04\n\nDave Podmore's - Ashes Quest - S01 - E01\nDave Podmore's - Ashes Quest - S01 - E02\n\nDave Podmore's - Ashes Special - S01 - E01\n\nDave Podmore's - Ashes - S01 - E01\n\nStrictly Dave Podmore - S01 - E01\n\nDave Podmore On The Stump - S01 - E01\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration Approx : 28mn 54s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43a3517543f82e0d0ab85ccaabc92718b15c402b","amp;dn":"Dave+Podmore+-+Cricket+Series+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43a3517543f82e0d0ab85ccaabc92718b15c402b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,163,81,117,67,248,46,13,10,184,92,202,171,201,39,24,177,92,64,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
