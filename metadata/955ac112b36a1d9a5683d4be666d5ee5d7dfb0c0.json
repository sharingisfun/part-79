It was directed by Ron Underwood, and stars Kevin Bacon,\nFred Ward, Finn Carter, Michael Gross and Reba McEntire. The film's\nexterior scenes were shot near Lone Pine, California, an area which has\nlong been used as a movie location.\n\nThe handymen team of Valentine McKee and Earl Bassett live in\nPerfection, Nevada, a decaying ex-mining town with only 14 residents,\namong them survivalist couple Burt and Heather Gummer and the\nnamesake owner of Walter Chang's General Store. A new arrival is\nRhonda LeBeck, a college student from Michigan State University who is\nconducting seismology tests around the town; Earl unsuccessfully\npromotes her as a possible girlfriend for Val.\n\nVal and Earl tire of their hand-to-mouth existence and set out for Bixby,\nthe nearest &quot;real&quot; town. En route, they discover Edgar Deems, the town\ndrunk, dead at the top of an electrical tower with a loaded rifle clutched in\nhis hands. Puzzled, Earl and Val haul his body to Jim, the town doctor,\nwho announces that Deems died of dehydration. On their second try at\nleaving, the duo come to the property of sheepherder &quot;Old Fred&quot; and find\nthat he and his flock have all been horribly butchered. Panicked, Val and\nEarl race back to Perfection, now thinking that a murderer is on the loose.\nThey warn two road-construction workers they meet, but soon something\nunderground kills the workers and causes a landslide, blocking the only\nroad out of town.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/b4e37543095216&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/b4e37543095216&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : Matroska\nFile size                        : 5.01 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 35mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 7497 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;175f7e707f575b233927&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 4 frames\nDuration                         : 1h 35mn\nBit rate                         : 5811 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                 : 5981 Kbps\nWidth                            : 1920 pixels\nHeight                           : 1080 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16/9\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\n\nAudio\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : DTS\nDuration                         : 1h 35mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 1536 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 6 channels","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:955ac112b36a1d9a5683d4be666d5ee5d7dfb0c0","amp;dn":"Tremors+1080p+HDRip+%5B+x264+-+dts+-+mkv+%5D+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"955ac112b36a1d9a5683d4be666d5ee5d7dfb0c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,90,193,18,179,106,29,154,86,131,212,190,102,109,94,229,215,223,176,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
