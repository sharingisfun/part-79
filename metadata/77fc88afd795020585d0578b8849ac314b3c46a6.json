Los Angeles native and erstwhile prodigy John Ondrasik really knows his way around a melody, bolstering it with a dramatic sense of timing and rhythm like a more modern and hipper Elton John. And that defiant chip does makes for powerful poetry, although oftentimes he sacrifices logic and clarity for the sake of iambic pentameter. While &quot;Superman&quot; is a catchy affair about the restrictions of being superhuman and the desire to belong (&quot;I'm only a man in a silly red sheet looking for special things inside me&quot;), it's doubtful that anyone who ever read a DC comic would believe that Superman would ever be &quot;digging for kryptonite on this one-way street,&quot; since a loose fragment from Superman's home planet might turn him into a blubbering infant or a giant ant. At best, Five for Fighting follows in the narrative-based path paved by Counting Crows.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77fc88afd795020585d0578b8849ac314b3c46a6","amp;dn":"Five+for+Fighting...America+Town%282000%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77fc88afd795020585d0578b8849ac314b3c46a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,252,136,175,215,149,2,5,133,208,87,139,136,73,172,49,75,60,70,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
