It was released on May 16, 2006 via One Little Indian Records on CD and double 12&quot; vinyl. During the recordings in 2005, Greg Dulli was aided by Manual Agnelli, who co-wrote &quot;My Time (Has Come)&quot; and &quot;The Conversation.&quot; &quot;My Time (Has Come)&quot; was first released in 2005 as &quot;White Widow&quot; on Afterhours' Ballads for Little Hyenas, which in turn was co-produced by Dulli. Other collaborators on this album are Joseph Arthur, Jeff Klein and Ani di Franco. The same recording sessions yielded the follow-up EP A Stitch in Time, released in early 2007.\n\nPowder Burns was partly recorded with extra power generators in a deserted New Orleans just after the floods caused by Hurricane Katrina.\n\nIt was released to positive reviews, and actor/comedian Denis Leary called it &quot;one of the best rock albums I've heard in 10 years,&quot; also putting the song &quot;Bonnie Brae&quot; in Rescue Me, his Emmy nominated TV series.
