In 2008, he released &quot;Scenes that You Know By Heart&quot; which\nfeatures live video versions of the same songs from the album plus two newer\nbonus tracks: &quot;Hey Good Lookin'&quot; and &quot;It's Five O'Clock Somewhere&quot;. Most of\nthe cuts are taken from different concerts around the world.\n\n1. Cheeseburger in Paradise\n2. He Went to Paris\n3. Fins\n4. Son of a Son of a Sailor\n5. Pirate Looks at Forty, A\n6. Margaritaville\n7. Come Monday\n8. Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes\n9. Why Don't We Get Drunk (And Screw!)\n10. Pencil Thin Mustache\n11. Grapefruit-Juicy Fruit\n12. Boat Drinks\n13. Volcano\n\n14. Hey Good Lookin'\n15. It's Five O'Clock Somewhere\n\nVideo: 464x352 anamorphically stretched to 16x9, XviD-insane, 29.97fps\nAudio: 128Kbps ABR Lame MP3 (using the louder 2ch wave source; there\nwas a softer 5:1 channel that I elected against.)\n\nDVD recommended? If you're a Buffett fan, you may already own it, especially\nif you have 5:1 and want the crowd to roar over the music for in-concert feel.\nNTSC DVD video was 30fps interlaced; isn't much if any better than rip.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e55b5da136f3440065fc76e4d376123c05605578","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Buffit+-+Scenes+Songs+That+You+Know+by+Heart","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e55b5da136f3440065fc76e4d376123c05605578","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,91,93,161,54,243,68,0,101,252,118,228,211,118,18,60,5,96,85,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
