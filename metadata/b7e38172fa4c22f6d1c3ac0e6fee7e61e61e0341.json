If your network card is not there, then you can\n\nuse a usb memory and copy from a friends computer. It ships with a crack\n\n( WPA Kill ). But that IS NOT NEEDED if you install the &quot;Pro Corp&quot;.\n\nThanks ----- enjoy ----- thanks\n\n\n\n\nPS. It is the best to not use automatic updates - this is secure enough with AVG free\nIt will only try to download SP3 and it will not install - the built in firewall is\nallready good - i do belive DS.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7e38172fa4c22f6d1c3ac0e6fee7e61e61e0341","amp;dn":"9N1.ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7e38172fa4c22f6d1c3ac0e6fee7e61e61e0341","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,227,129,114,250,76,34,246,209,195,172,14,111,238,126,97,230,30,3,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
