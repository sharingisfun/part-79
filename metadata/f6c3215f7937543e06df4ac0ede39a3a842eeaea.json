The track later featured on the Face to Face album as well as being the title track for their 1967 compilation album. Its strong Music Hall flavour and lyrical focus was part of a stylistic departure for the band (begun with 1965's &quot;A Well Respected Man&quot;), who had risen to fame in 1964-65 with a series of hard-driving, power-chord rock hits.\n\nReleased as a single in 3 June 1966, it went to number 1 on the UK charts on 7 July 1966, remaining there for two weeks. The track also went to number 1 in Ireland on 18 July 1966. In America, it peaked at number fourteen. &quot;Sunny Afternoon&quot; was placed at #200 on Pitchfork Media's list of The 200 Greatest Songs of the 1960s.\n\nRay Davies CBE (born Raymond Douglas Davies, 21 June 1944, Fortis Green, London) is an English rock musician, best known as lead singer and songwriter for The Kinks - one of the most prolific and long-lived British Invasion bands - which he led with his younger brother, Dave. He has also acted, directed and produced shows for theatre and television.\n\nSince the demise of the Kinks in the mid-90s Ray Davies has embarked on a solo career as a singer-songwriter.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6c3215f7937543e06df4ac0ede39a3a842eeaea","amp;dn":"Kinks%2FRay+Davies+-+Sunny+Afternoon+%28Live%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6c3215f7937543e06df4ac0ede39a3a842eeaea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,195,33,95,121,55,84,62,6,223,74,192,237,227,154,58,132,46,234,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
