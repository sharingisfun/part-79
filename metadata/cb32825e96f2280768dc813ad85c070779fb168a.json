It is a concept executed by director Rajesh Ranshinge by merging facts and fictional events.\nThe movie is a narrative about two female protagonists Anushka and Ahana. Anushka wedded an elderly man named Ravi. Ravi ties the knot for the second time after an unknown death of his first wife Pooja. Anushka's mother is a single conservative parent who totally refuses to accept their relationship. However her only help in distress is her sister Ahana.\n\nThe couple begins their journey in a beautiful home purchased by Ravi two years ago. Their life was content until one day... when unexpected turns and twists take place in Anushka's life. Anushka tries to share her experiences with her husband, who in turn thinks that his wife is hallucinating and so decides to move back to his earlier house.\n\nAlthough the horror doesn't seem to stop in this house either. Anushka is petrified and suspects that Pooja is behind all these nerve wrecking incidents. While Anushka tries to discover the motive behind these unexplainable incidents, her husband and sister-in-law get murdered. She is charged with murder for the same and hence is taken to an asylum.\n\nRun Time: 115 minutes\nLanguage: Hindi\nSubtitles: English Hard Subbed\n\ncredit Infectious (JDPennington) BIG BIG BIG TIME &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb32825e96f2280768dc813ad85c070779fb168a","amp;dn":"RoKKK+DVDRip+XviD+LKRG+%26+JDPennington%28ENG+SUBS%29%5BExtraTorrent%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb32825e96f2280768dc813ad85c070779fb168a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,50,130,94,150,242,40,7,104,220,129,58,216,92,7,7,121,251,22,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
