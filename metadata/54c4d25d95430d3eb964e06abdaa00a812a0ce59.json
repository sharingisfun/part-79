Styles range from the shuffling &quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot; to the energetic workout &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; to the slow blues of &quot;Sorry For Your Heartache&quot;. Blues guitar fans will have a feast, as there's no skimping on the solos here. For example, on the rolling &quot;Blues All Night Long&quot;, the duo trade off for a solid three minutes of stellar soloing. They have some fun on the perky &quot;Diamond&quot;, and Derringer again launches into some tasty guitarwork on the slightly funky &quot;Crybaby&quot;. Once more, the pair stretch out for some extended solos on the sultry &quot;Time to Go&quot; to close things out.\n\nTrack List:\n\n1. Trouble in Paradise \n2. Blue Suede Blues \n3.
