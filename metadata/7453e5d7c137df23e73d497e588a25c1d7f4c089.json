The answer is both to the past and future with their latest album and first of many on new label Tasteful Licks Records. With the album &quot;A Mind on A ship through Time&quot;, emcee Raw Poetic weaves together a series of personal and fictitious short stories backed by K-Murdock's unpredictable yet consistently spacey and soulful tracks. The outcome makes for another sonic progression for the tandem while they conversely explore some of the past events that have helped to shape them in and especially out of the music.\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7453e5d7c137df23e73d497e588a25c1d7f4c089","amp;dn":"Panacea+-+A+Mind+on+a+Ship+Through+Time+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7453e5d7c137df23e73d497e588a25c1d7f4c089","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,83,229,215,193,55,223,35,231,61,73,126,88,138,37,193,215,244,192,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
