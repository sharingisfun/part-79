In order to fake a fingerprint, you need an original first. Fingerprints consist of nothing but fat and sweat on touched items. Therefore in order to retrieve someone elses fingerprint - in this case the fingerprint you want to forge - you should rely on well tested forensic research methods. How this is done will be explained here.\n\nComment:\n\nDo you fear a conspiracy? Make your own one! Creating a new identity is your first step and for a new identity you need new fingerprints. Technical: This video is in german, but it is highly useful anyway. The text file explains and replaces the german sound in the video.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfc5d7728df69c88dedca43e7e182abd3f36395c","amp;dn":"A+Brief+Tutorial+on+Faking+Fingerprints","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfc5d7728df69c88dedca43e7e182abd3f36395c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,197,215,114,141,246,156,136,222,220,164,62,126,24,42,189,63,54,57,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
