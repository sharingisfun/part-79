Perhaps because this film is one of JancsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³'s more conventional films with respect to story, it has been marginalised in overviews of JancsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³'s career and especially relative to SzegÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nylegÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nyek (The Round-up, 1965) and Csillagosok, katonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡k, despite the fact that the three films are sometimes considered as a forming a &quot;trilogy&quot; together. Nevertheless, the film is an absorbing one and it looks forward to works such as ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°gi bÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ny, Szerelmem, Elektra (Electreia, 1974) and SzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rnyek ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©vadja (Season of Monsters, 1986) in that it focuses on a dual of individual personalities.\n\nIn visual style, the film looks forward, too. This was the first film with JanÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³s Kende as cinematographer (he was an assistant on Csillagosok, katonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡k), and a distinct aesthetic of choreographed camera movements appears in its nascent form.\n\nMain feature;\nData source: DVD\nRuntime: 01:32:29\nVideo format: NTSC\nFPS: 23.976\nSize: 624 x 288\nVideo bitrate (kbps): 918\nVideo codec: xvid4\n2-pass-encoded: yes\nFast resizing: yes\nDeinterlacer filter: No deinterlacing\nAntialiasing filter: No antialiasing\nAudio codec: mp3\nChannels: 2\nSample rate: 48000\nAudio bitrate (kbps): 128\n\nExtra:\nData source: DVD\nRuntime: 00:29:58\nVideo format: NTSC\nFPS: 23.976\nVideo bitrate (kbps): 1260\nVideo codec: xvid4\n2-pass-encoded: yes\nFast resizing: no\nDeinterlacer filter: No deinterlacing\nAntialiasing filter: No antialiasing\nAudio codec: mp3\nChannels: 2\nSample rate: 48000\nAudio bitrate (kbps): 128","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2461403db7b96f87a8c278ee22bfe04a0d5f36b7","amp;dn":"Csend+%C3%83%C2%A9s+ki%C3%83%C2%A1lt%C3%83%C2%A1s+AKA+Silence+and+Cry+%281968%29.+DvDrip.EN.FR.SPA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2461403db7b96f87a8c278ee22bfe04a0d5f36b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,97,64,61,183,185,111,135,168,194,120,238,34,191,224,74,13,95,54,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
