Space filled us with optimism and awe. But were we in fact just staking out a new war zone? Space weapons feature prominently in science fiction, but how close are we to seeing real weapons systems in space? Today, 1000 active satellites are officially recorded as circling the earth. Most countries use satellite technology. And 45 nations own their own orbiting satellites. By shutting down a few satellites, the infrastructure of an entire country or continent can be paralyzed.\n\n[IMG]http://i741.photobucket.com/albums/xx51/Temptation_016/The%20Nature%20of%20Things%20-%20Masters%20of%20Space/frame_1.jpg[/IMG]\n\nNow, the United States is the Master of Space. It dominates as the owner and user of space systems, both civilian and military. &quot;Full spectrum dominance&quot; - control and dominance of land, sea, air and, more recently, space, is still the goal of some within the U.S. Defense Department. But what are the realities behind these aims? Trying to track down what the Defense Department is spending on space weapons projects is a tricky business.\n\n[IMG]http://i741.photobucket.com/albums/xx51/Temptation_016/The%20Nature%20of%20Things%20-%20Masters%20of%20Space/frame_2.jpg[/IMG]\n\nWhen Hitler had the first V2 missile launched in 1944, the weapons race in space officially began. [i]Masters of Space[/i] is the saga of the emerging competition between the major industrial nations to control space and the fine line between space-faring and space warfare.\n\nWith unprecedented access to present and former US military personnel, and insights from anti-weapons activists, as well as military analysts, [i]Masters of Space[/i] explores space as a &quot;new arena for war&quot;.\n\n[IMG]http://i741.photobucket.com/albums/xx51/Temptation_016/The%20Nature%20of%20Things%20-%20Masters%20of%20Space/frame_3.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[i]Masters of Space[/i] is directed by Denis Delestrac for Lowik Media and [url=http://www.coptor.com/]Coptor Productions.[/url] \n\nEpisode webpage:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/documentaries/natureofthings/2010/mastersofspace/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/documentaries/natureofthings/2010/mastersofspace/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----\n\n***TV CAP***\n\nFile Name:............Masters.of.Space.avi\nRuntime:..............00:43:59\nFilesize:.............560.02 MB\n\nLanguage:.............English\nSubtitles:............None\n\nVideo codec:..........XviD MPEG-4 codec\nVideo aspect ratio:...1.73:1\nVideo width x height:.720 x 416\nVideo framerate:......23.976 FPS\nVideo bitrate:........1652 KB/s\n\nAudio type:...........MPEG-1 Layer 3 (MP3)\nAudio channels:.......2 Ch\nAudio sample rate:....48000 Hz\nAudio bitrate:........128 KB/s (CBR)\n\n*** Thanks to [b]privategomer[/b] for capping and uploading this episode ***\n\n-----\n\n[b]CBC - The Nature of Things with David Suzuki[/b]\n\nRare wildlife, unique perspectives, cutting-edge science and tech--Canada's longest running documentary series, the award-winning [i]The Nature of Things with David Suzuki[/i], cuts through the hype to bring you the latest stories from the frontlines of science and the environment. \n\nCBC's [i]The Nature of Things with David Suzuki[/i] website:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/documentaries/natureofthings/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/documentaries/natureofthings/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0fc1ab5c4e48c397f9febf8e5fa0aaabfc78d64","amp;dn":"CBC+The+Nature+of+Things%3A+Masters+of+Space","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0fc1ab5c4e48c397f9febf8e5fa0aaabfc78d64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,252,26,181,196,228,140,57,127,159,235,248,229,250,10,170,191,199,141,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
