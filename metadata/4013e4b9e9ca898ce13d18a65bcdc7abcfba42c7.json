By optimizing as many routines as possible without losing user friendliness, Notepad++ is trying to reduce the world carbon dioxide emissions. When using less CPU power, the PC can throttle down and reduce power consumption, resulting in a greener environment.\n\nThis project is mature. However, there may be still some bugs and missing features that are being worked on.\n\nI hope you enjoy Notepad++ as much as I enjoy coding it.\n\n\nHere are the features of Notepad++ :\n\n\nSyntax Highlighting and Syntax Folding \n\nSupported languages:\n\nC\nC++\nJava\nC#\nXML\nHTML\nPHP\nCSS\nmakefile\nASCII art (.nfo)\ndoxygen\nini file\nbatch file\nJavascript\nASP\nVB/VBS\nSQL\nObjective-C\nRC resource file\nPascal\nPerl\nPython\nLua\nTeX\nTCL\nAssembler\nRuby\nLisp\nScheme\nProperties\nDiff\nSmalltalk\nPostscript\nVHDL\nAda\nCaml\nAutoIt\nKiXtart\nMatlab\nVerilog\nHaskell\nInnoSetup\nCMake\nYAML\n\n\nWYSIWYG \n\nIf you have a colour printer, print your source code (or whatever you want) in colour.\n\n\nUser Defined Syntax Highlighting \n\nIt allows user to define his own language : not only the syntax highlighting keywords, but also the syntax folding keywords, comment keywords and the operators.\n\n\nAuto-completion \n\nFor most supported languages, user can make his/her own API list.\nOnce the api file is ready, type Ctrl+Space to launch this action.\n\n\nMulti-Document \n\nYou can edit several documents at the same time.\n\n\nMulti-View \n\nYou have two views at same time. That means you can visualize (edit) 2 different documents at the same time. You can visualize (edit) in the 2 views one document at 2 different positions as well. The modification of document in one view will carry out in another view (i.e. you modify the SAME document when you are in clone mode). \n\n\nRegular Expression Search/Replace supported \n\nYou can search and replace one string in the document by using the regular expression.\n\n\nFull Drag ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“N' Drop supported \n\nYou can open a document by drag &amp; drop.\nYou can also move your document from a position (or even a view) to another by drag &amp; drop. \n\n\nDynamic position of Views \n\nThe user can set the position of the views dynamically (only in 2 views mode : the splitter can be set in horizontal or in vertical). \n\n\nFile Status Auto-detection \n\nIf you modify or delete a file which opened in Notepad++, you will be notified to update your document (reload the file or remove the file). \n\n\nZoom in and zoom out \n\nThat's another fantastic function of Scintilla component.\n\n\nMulti-Language environment supported \n\nThe Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic and Hebrew Windows environments are supported.\n\n\nBookmark \n\nUser can just click on the bookmark margin (located right side of line number margin) or type Ctrl+F2 to toggle a book mark.\nTo reach the bookmark, type just F2 (Next bookmark) or Shift+F2 (Previous bookmark). To clear all bookmarks, click the Menu Search-&gt;Clear All bookmarks.\n\n\nBrace and Indent guideline Highlighting \n\nWhen the caret stay beside of one of those symbol { } [ ] ( ) , the symbol beside of caret and its symmetric opposite symbol will be highlighted, as well as the indent guideline (if any) in order to locate the block more easily.\n\n\nMacro recording and playback \n\nYou can save several macros and edit their keyboard shorcuts for the next use.\n\n\nChangelog:\n\n\nNotepad++ v5.5 new features and fixed bugs (from v5.4.5) :\n\n\nUpdate : Upgrade Scintilla from v1.78 to v2.01.\n\n\nNew icon : Change from old icon to a cool chamelon icon.\n\n\nNew feature : Virtual space for column mode.\n\nNew feature : Multi-editing / selection.\n\nNew feature : Tab settings for per language.\n\nNew feature : Selected lines moving up/down capacity.\n\nNew feature : Incremental Search shows pink background when text not found (like Firefox).\n\nNew feature : Rational number is recognized in User Defined Language System.\n\nNew feature : Escape character capacity for the delimiter in User Defined Language System.\n\n\nBug fixed : Tool bar tip crash issue.\n\nBug fixed : Column editor inserting octal number broken issue.\n\n\nChanged behaviour : &quot;-nosession&quot; parameter's not only none of session is loaded, but also none of session is saved.\n\n\nBug fixed : Docking feature crash issue.\n\n\nNew feature : The ability to not launch Auto-updater during a period (15 days by default).\n\nNew feature : Import plugins feature (load on the fly).\n\nNew feature : Import theme (stylers.xml) feature.\n\n\nBug fixed : A crash issue while launch Fin in file (regression since v5.4.5).\n\nBug fixed : A crash issue while deleting the last line.\n\nBug fixed : A bug of plugin message NPPM_GETPLUGINSCONFIGDIR (regression since v5.4.5).\n\n\nNew feature : New plugin notification NPPN_DOCORDERCHANGED to notify plugins that document order is changed.\n\n\nBug fixed : Tool bar chevron disappeared bug (regression since previous versions).\n\nBug fixed : A crash bug due to instability of FTP_synchronize plugin (enhance Docking feature).\n\nBug fixed : Getting fonts problem under Chines/Korean/Japanese environment.\n\nBug fixed : Wrong File encoding auto-detection problem : binary file is detected as UTF-16 big-endian.\n\n\nIncluded plugins (Unicode):\n\n1.
