Aspiring journalist Greg Bachmann (Buchholz) has just been released from prison and is looking for some honest work. Soon hired as assistant to influential yellow journalist Cesar Boyd (Martin Held), Bachmann is shocked to discover that his new employer has concocted the story of a blind Nazi soldier discovered in a bunker years after the end of World War II in order to meet a looming deadline. When other reporters latch on to the story and run a phony picture of the long-lost soldier, a peaceful protest aimed at pressuring authorities to release the man quickly elevate into a full-scale riot. Now, with all of Europe in chaos, Bachmann must race to expose the fraudulent scoop and spread the word about the dangers of tabloid reporting.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Nasser Asphalt.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.09 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 29mn\n      Bit rate : 1750 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 10.8 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Custom\n      PlayTime : 1h 29mn\n      Bit rate : 1641 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.222\n      StreamSize : 1.02 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 1h 29mn\n      Bit rate : 101 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 64.1 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.97 \n      Encoding settings : ABR\n\nEnglish audio; Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted originally at Karagarga by BucasYotos","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:017188d9254abe333818a4c848a2b925db4f5851","amp;dn":"Frank+Wisbar+-+Nasser+Asphalt+%281958%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"017188d9254abe333818a4c848a2b925db4f5851","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,113,136,217,37,74,190,51,56,24,164,200,72,162,185,37,219,79,88,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
