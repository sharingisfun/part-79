The plot in incredibly thin, but who watches these things for a plot anyway? The fighting scenes are plenty and they are well choreographed. A distinct (and quite unusual for this genre) feature of the movie is the presence of MMA/judo techniques. Donnie is insanely agile for a 44 year old guy. \n\nCast: Donnie Yen, Louis Koo, Collin Chou, Yu Xing.\n\nAnyways, enjoy the flick.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc35fd1ed34d216dfe8e7ee6e192bc19485e6bf6","amp;dn":"Flashpoint+%2F+Dou+fo+sin+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc35fd1ed34d216dfe8e7ee6e192bc19485e6bf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,53,253,30,211,77,33,109,254,142,126,230,225,146,188,25,72,94,107,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
