At that time Amnesty International had 3000 members\nin the UK and was struggling to raise funds for its campaigns. The shows had\na dramatic effect and Amnesty's UK membership rose by a staggering 700% in\nthree years. Amnesty International is now firmly established as the world's\nlargest international human rights organisation with a worldwide membership of\nover 1 million people. We are still struggling to raise the necessary funds!\nSince Amnesty International was founded, its members and supporters have\nachieved much and helped to save many thousands of lives. The contribution to\nhuman rights made by the performers and everyone involved in making these\nshows has been huge and simply cannot be overstated.\nAmnesty International would like to pay tribute and give very special thanks\nto all the performers, producers, directors and the many hundreds of people\nwho gave their time, energy and remarkable performances to make these\nground-breaking shows possible. And for making them so good that they ore\nstill making us laugh and still raising funds to help save lives today.\nWe thank you all.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a84768175a5db7c09268c57f433108dee1169b3f","amp;dn":"The+Secret+Policeman%5C%27s+Ball.+The+Complete+Edition.+Volume+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a84768175a5db7c09268c57f433108dee1169b3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,71,104,23,90,93,183,192,146,104,197,127,67,49,8,222,225,22,155,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
