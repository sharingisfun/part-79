Retired police officer Jack McLamb of the Phoenix Police Department gives a special and dynamic presentation and details the role of unsuspecting police officers and soldiers used to carry out the hidden agendas of the elite few wishing to control the people of the world and in particular Americans. This is one of the most complete and documented presentations of how and why Americans are being manipulated. Police officers who have been taught that the citizens are their enemy need to open their hearts and minds, not for Jack McLamb, but for themselves and their families. Excellent presentation detailing New World Order infiltration of local police departments and sheriff's offices and how local police will be used to implement the globalist agenda and how some officers are determined to fight back. 2 hours long. A must see for everyone.\n\nVideo specs:\nVideo codec: divx, 720x480, 500 kbps\nAudio codec: tag 200, 48kHz, Stereo\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f51466f218419dd47a5974d23e864555d4637e2","amp;dn":"Operation+Backfire%28NWO+training+of+police+officers%29%28Jack+McLamb%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f51466f218419dd47a5974d23e864555d4637e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,81,70,111,33,132,25,221,71,165,151,77,35,232,100,85,93,70,55,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
