It's been a little while and we're still trying to knock some of the rust off but we've returned with a great interview with Laura Marlowe and Pamela Gray. This show's news segment was slightly haphazard but we're still trying to work out how we want to do the first half of the show. If you're interested in joining in the fun for a show or two, send us an email, call the show voicemail (714-656-3487), or post on the forums. We look forward to more wonderful interviews and we're glad you're still with us!\n\nThis week we interview Laura Marlowe and Pamela Gray, the president and treasurer of the California Dreamin' transgender conference. The conference, now in its fourth year under the current board, is held yearly in San Jose, California. Laura and Pamela have a long history in the San Francisco Bay Area TG community and we hope you find their interview as fun and informative as we did.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12a4d4b5eb132327063093160be341c43b2f4a5f","amp;dn":"Susans+Radio+Show+Online+%28SRS-O%29+Shows+16+-+20","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12a4d4b5eb132327063093160be341c43b2f4a5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,164,212,181,235,19,35,39,6,48,147,22,11,227,65,196,59,47,74,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
