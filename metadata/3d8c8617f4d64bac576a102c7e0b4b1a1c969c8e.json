Even  if you run\nWindows  DreamScene that makes  your  desktop background an  animated   motion  wallpaper  or\nvideo,  as  time passes it will  be less  interesting  as the  motion   picture keeps  repeating itself. If \nthis is the case, how about feed a pet bird on your desktop? \n\nDesktopBird is a  small  desktop  pet bird program. Once run, DesktopBird will create a  little lovely \nkingfisher  that  flies  around  your screen,  occasionally  performing  its  daily bird behavior  routine. \nAnd  the bird is interactive too, and will interact and response  to  your mouse clicks. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s especially\nnice  if  you have  Windows Vista DreamScene running natural   especial river or sea themed  video \nbackground.\n\nSuch  actions  such  as  the pet kingfisher  sometimes  may  land, sit and  rest on top of your open \nwindow, toolbar or taskbar. If you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t  like  your  desktop  pet  bird  sitting  there, simply drag and\n drop her around the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢skyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (your desktop). When you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t like the  bird  to  flying  around  particular\n space you may  stop  it too. It  also hops along  like  any  bird  would  do, and  also  dive  into your\n taskbar to fish for food. Want to  kill  the birdie? Simply drag it and  put inside or near  your  bottom \ntaskbar, and you will see it flying lower and lower, and finally lying idle on the bottom, as if itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dead.\n\n\n******************************************************************************************************************\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENT:\n******************************************************************************************************************\nThe  tiny  application will work on most versions and editions of Windows, including Windows Vista \nand Windows XP.\n\n******************************************************************************************************************\nINSTALLATION INSTRUCTION:\n******************************************************************************************************************\n\nNo installatin required.
