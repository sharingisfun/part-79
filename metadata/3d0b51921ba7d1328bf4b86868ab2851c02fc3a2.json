With Michael Cretu as soul inspiring, Seven Lives Many Faces is their seventh album and a new chapter in their particular creative universe. There are 12 songs that surpass the boundaries of the known sound spectrum, broadening the horizon to create a world acoustic sound omnicultural. The album's first single, the song Seven Lives, was the official theme song of Germany in the last Summer Olympics. A dynamic song that mixes classical and modern environments with symphony orchestra and hip-hop rhythms, offering a unique sonic palette. \n\n&quot;Seven Lives Many Faces&quot; is a continuation of the career of Enigma, a path that began in 1990 with their debut album &quot;MCMXC aD&quot;. Then came &quot;The Cross of Changes&quot; (1993) recorded in Ibiza and all following &quot;Le roi est mort&quot; (1996) including music from Mongolia, &quot;The Screen Behind the Mirror&quot; (2000) with parts of Carmina Burana by Carl Orff, &quot;Voyageur&quot; (2003) and &quot;A Posteriori&quot; (2006) dedicated to all the visionaries of the world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d0b51921ba7d1328bf4b86868ab2851c02fc3a2","amp;dn":"Enigma-Seven+Lives+Many+Faces+%282008%29+%5BDVD5%5D%5BPAL%5D%5BCONCIERTO%5D+By+j","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d0b51921ba7d1328bf4b86868ab2851c02fc3a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,11,81,146,27,167,209,50,139,244,184,104,104,171,40,81,192,47,195,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
