Gets rid of the anoying logo ads when the game starts.\nNOT NOW!\n\nCopy these files into the Bionic Commandodatamovies folder.\n(in case this doesnt show the backslashes, find the &quot;Bionic Commando&quot; folder then the &quot;data&quot; folder then the &quot;movies&quot; folder and unzip this in there)\n\nThis file contains 5 of the ad logos that drag the starting of the game out to a couple of minutes, but not now.\n\nStart the game and wala! go right to the game!!! \n\nAll I did was zero out the &quot;bik&quot; ad intro.\n\nYou still get the game intro, just not the minute long adds!\n\nThis file is zipped up, so download and just unzip it in that folder!\n\nBe watching for more for other games as over the next few days I will be releasing a \nbunch more of these.\n\n(Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯`Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¸Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¸.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯`Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·-=BeDLaM=- @ TiMeS2 FxPÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â·Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯`Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¸Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¸.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a3db8888ffb0850720a8c2f9a3de291e257e998","amp;dn":"Bionic+Commando+Log+Ad+Replaceme.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a3db8888ffb0850720a8c2f9a3de291e257e998","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,61,184,136,143,251,8,80,114,10,140,47,154,61,226,145,226,87,233,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
