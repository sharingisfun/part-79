Larger than life action is what Duke is all about, mixed with humor and innovative explosive action in this 20+ hour game.\n\nLos Angeles. Under attack by aliens intent on stealing our chicks for breeding. Duke Nukem springs into action dealing damage like only he can, making his &quot;insightful&quot; comments along the way. If you've never played a Duke game, this is your chance to see why he's been a fan favorite since 1991, with over 18 original Duke Nukem games since that time. Duke Nukem is not the typical faceless hero -- he's an in-your-face hero who has a personality that doesn't quit. Yes, it's a B-movie plot, but that's what makes it fun!\n\nA NEW WAY TO KILL\n\nThis high-powered iPhone 3D engine supports TapShoot(tm), a unique way to play first-person shooters on the iPhone and iTouch, taking full advantage of the unique touch screen interface to easily and quickly aim and shoot enemies, without the frustration of trying to line up your weapon perfectly. Once you've experienced TapShoot, you'll wish all FPS games on the iPhone had this breakthrough feature.\n\nCUSTOMIZED CONTROLS\n\nYes, we have the thumb-stick style controller, but we've also pioneered another way to guide Duke through levels, using slider-style controls.\nPractically everyone who's playtested the game thinks this new method is superior. And this along with the TapShoot feature makes Duke Nukem 3D a blast to play on the iPhone.\n\nTHE PRESS HAS ITS SAY!\n\nMetacritic Player Rating: 9.4 of 10.\n\n&quot;It's the ultimate game for unleashing all your pent-up aggression. It is the most astonishing game we've laid our eyes on for ages! In fact, it makes pretty much every PC game we've ever seen - &quot;Doom&quot; included - like slightly dull. Honestly!&quot; -- PC Gamer\n\n&quot;It's more inventive, and more entertaining, than &quot;Doom.&quot; I know they've had long enough to get it right (but so have many others, who've tried and failed).&quot; -- Computer and Video Games\n\n&quot;It's rare when a game comes along that really kicks your a*s. With its free-flowing 3D action, over-the-top weapons, and ruthlessly attitudinal protagonist, Duke Nukem will have PC gamers worldwide rubbing their rumps with spine-tingling glee.&quot; -- Gamespot\n\n&quot;I couldn't stop laughing while playing this extremely enjoyable trip through what unfolds like a 1950's science fiction B-movie: Space Aliens Invade Earth for Women!...Duke Nukem has what most first-person shooters don't - character!&quot; -- PC Gameworld\n\nIf you like Duke Nukem 3D, also be sure to check out Prey Invasion, based on the award-winning game by the makers of Duke Nukem.\n\nDuke Nukem 3D (c)2009 3D Realms, Inc.
