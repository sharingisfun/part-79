Lily Champagne (Krysten Ritter) is a twenty-something clinically depressed outcast looking for the love that her father never gave her. Robert Collingsworth (Ivan Sergei), an ophthalmologist, is despondent following the cancer death of his wife and becomes an internet celebrity when his suicide attempt goes comically awry. Miller (Eric Schaeffer), an NYPD cop, seems to be everywhere Lily is. Dogg McFee (Ving Rhames), the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s leader and a former Major League Baseball player, is now confined to a wheelchair. Shawna Rollins (Rachel Hunter), a former spokesmodel and current life coach, is surprised to find herself attracted to someone much younger than herself (Seth Numrich).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7de0bce0a2f1bbdb0e9e7aaf85af63eb6152b740","amp;dn":"Gravity+S01E05+720p+HDTV+x264-IMMERSE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7de0bce0a2f1bbdb0e9e7aaf85af63eb6152b740","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,224,188,224,162,241,187,219,14,158,122,175,133,175,99,235,97,82,183,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
