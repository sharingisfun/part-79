MABUS record ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLORD OF THE BLACK SHEEPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (2006). The first of its mutant breed in Detroit, A.K.A. MABUS was an experimental grindpunk outfit that burned fast &amp; hard for a year of psychological warfare before imploding.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLORD OF THE BLACK SHEEPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is drenched in true sweat, true fury &amp; raw as a condom made of broken glass. Features USA journalist Ryan Bartek (author of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTHE BIG SHINY PRISONÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) on guitar &amp; drummer August Kreuger of death metal heavyweights FLESH EATING FLESH, with members of CONFESSED ARSONIST &amp; COLUMBIAN NECKTIE.\n\nREVIEW FROM METAL MANIACS MAGAZINE, MAY 2007: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt's like sledding down a mountain of landmines, hauling ass like a champ to ensure you're past the next one when it blows, damn close to becoming pink snow each time. Blending grindcore, punk, industrial and thrash elements together, exposure to A.K.A. MABUS incites an anarchic, uncontainable explosion of neurotic hate the punks, grinders, 'bangers and all chaos-born heathens into raw, demented, metallic battery will likely dig. And it bore no surprise upon first listen... A dude who expresses his inner rage towards modern humanity in any artistic way possible, 'Maniacs' writer/musician/pissed American Ryan Bartek helps man this act. I am sure others involved share and contribute to the bands message. End-bringing apocalyptic/anarcho, proto/retro, genre crossbreeding has resulted in something that's immediately familair yet completely innovative. I need not ass comparisons since it genre-jumps/mangles nonstop. Discerningly catchy, pathologically corrosive and (hopefully) morally corruptive, 'Lord Of The Black Sheep' is a fucking outstanding display of what America can produce musically, yet will remind you of its evils and contradictions in every syllable.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ -Dave Brenner\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a8d3d4fdc3980dad7fb5c23491bd14eb25a464b","amp;dn":"A.K.A.+MABUS+-+LORD+OF+THE+BLACK+SHEEP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a8d3d4fdc3980dad7fb5c23491bd14eb25a464b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,141,61,79,220,57,128,218,215,251,92,35,73,27,209,78,178,90,70,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
