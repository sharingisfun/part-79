The characters are modelled on computer in 3D and are then set against real scenery. Each animation has a short, self-contained and often humorous storyline. The audio is a combination of genuine insect and ambient recordings, and sound effects such as car or helicopter or aircraft engines, synthesized buzzings etc. Throughout each episode, no (human) words are ever spoken; nevertheless, anthropogenic 'insect-like words' are often trumpeted by the various protagonist insects. The background settings are mostly of rural France, and include farm houses, fences, cars, road surfaces, drains, gutters and garbage bins. Humans themselves appear only peripherally (if at all) and the only consistent peripheral witnesses to many of the goings-on are cows that appear as uninterested bystanders.\n\nNo need for subs.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56bed06a0ea44c8941d6443cd8814bb4047f3115","amp;dn":"Minuscule+Vol+6+-+Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56bed06a0ea44c8941d6443cd8814bb4047f3115","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,190,208,106,14,164,76,137,65,214,68,60,216,129,75,180,4,127,49,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
