They had a hit with the single &quot;On and On&quot;, and refer to their music as &quot;athletic rock&quot;.\n\nManager/Megaforce founder Johnny Zazula believed that Raven was major-label material, and kept them touring constantly until the big labels noticed. The infamous Live at the Inferno recording, released in 1984, was a product of one of those tours. Atlantic Records signed Raven to a worldwide contract after a minor bidding war (major label contracts would follow for Metallica and Anthrax in the following year). The band moved its permanent base from Newcastle to New York.\n\nStay Hard was released in 1985, and proved a minor hit on the strength of single/video &quot;On and On&quot;. The Atlantic years proved to be less-than-stellar for the band. A drastic shift in a more commercial direction came at the label's behest, with many die-hard fans being alienated by the slick, lightweight production of The Pack Is Back (effectively marketing the band with their weird musical forays, and confusing image was likely very difficult). However, the band recorded two more studio albums and the Mad EP before being let go by Atlantic.\n\nAfter the tour for Life's a Bitch, Rob &quot;Wacko&quot; Hunter left the band in 1988 to spend more time with his new wife and family. He would later pursue a career in audio production and engineering, eventually working with jazz greats Branford Marsalis and Harry Connick, Jr..\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d5088f9494d6e1a0520c70a4a44c2337e38f853","amp;dn":"Raven+-+On+And+On","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d5088f9494d6e1a0520c70a4a44c2337e38f853","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,80,136,249,73,77,110,26,5,32,199,10,74,68,194,51,126,56,248,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
