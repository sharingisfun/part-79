We are taught to hide and suppress negative aspects of ourselves such as being angry, selfish, or mean-- but, by not accepting these parts, people can end up sabotaging themselves, and seeing these traits surface in unwanted ways, she explained.\n\nThe dark side in ourselves is not equated with evil, but rather part of just being human, she said. Addiction, she noted, is a disease of the mind and brought on by the locked up and suppressed aspects of our ourselves. Through &quot;shadow work,&quot; people make peace with themselves, and find compassion for their imperfections, said Ford. \n\nThe process can begin by naming the thing you like best about yourself, and figuring out what the opposite of that is-- that is one of your shadow traits, she detailed. Once a person's different shadow aspects have been identified, through activities such as journaling, these traits can be understood, attended to, and integrated into one's persona, she added.\n\nNew Hominid &amp; Intervention Theory\n\nFirst hour guest, researcher Lloyd Pye reacted to reports about a newly discovered hominid. He believes this finding strengthens the case that humans are not part of the natural evolution of primates on Earth, and were likely developed through some type of intervention.\n\nWebsite(s):\ndebbieford.com\nlloydpye.com\nVideo(s):\nThe Shadow Effect\n\nBook(s):\nThe Dark Side of Light Chasers\nThe Secret of the Shadow\nStarchild Skull Essentials\n\n\n\nbrought to you by:\n                                                \n .d8888b.                                                      888    \nd88P  Y88b                                                     888    \n888    888                                                     888    \n888    888 888  888  .d88b.  888d888 .d8888b  8888b.  .d8888b  888888 \n888    888 888  888 d8P  Y8b 888P&quot;  d88P&quot;        &quot;88b 88K      888    \n888    888 Y88  88P 88888888 888    888      .d888888 &quot;Y8888b. 888    \nY88b  d88P  Y8bd8P  Y8b.     888    Y88b.    888  888      X88 Y88b.  \n &quot;Y8888P&quot;    Y88P    &quot;Y8888  888     &quot;Y8888P &quot;Y888888  88888P'  &quot;Y888 \n\nTorrents: http://thepiratebay.se/user/0vercast/\nRSS: http://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/2eb7e342dacfa8938e79732ad03e1224","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8472a59c9547693cb355276e818ff9e412114215","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+AM+-+Oct+04+2009+-+Exploring+the+Dark+Side","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8472a59c9547693cb355276e818ff9e412114215","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,114,165,156,149,71,105,60,179,85,39,110,129,143,249,228,18,17,66,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
