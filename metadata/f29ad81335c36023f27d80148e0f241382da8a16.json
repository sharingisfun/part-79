The single was not commercially released in the \nUnited States.\n\nTwo mixes of the song have been released, one which fades out, and one which \ndoes not. The alternate version is on the CD re-release of Speak and Spell in \nEurope, while the American Speak and Spell (and all singles compilations \ncontaining the song) has the regular version. The re-release of Speak and Spell \nin 2006 also features the no-fade out version, and was released in all regions.\n\nThe B-Side, &quot;Ice Machine,&quot; is similarly available in a fading version, and an \nalternate non-fading version. The song is also a bonus track on the CD rerelease \nof Speak and Spell in the UK. The 1986 and 2006 re-releases of Speak and Spell \nuse the no-fade out version. A live version of &quot;Ice Machine&quot; (recorded during \nthe Some Great Reward tour) is available on the 12&quot; version of the 1984 single, \n&quot;Blasphemous Rumours.&quot;\n\nDue to a poor chart placement (#57 on the UK singles chart), &quot;Dreaming of Me&quot; \ndid not originally appear on Speak and Spell, but did show up in the CD re-\nrelease in the UK as a bonus track. In the United States, &quot;Dreaming of Me&quot; was \non the original pressing of the album, replacing &quot;I Sometimes Wish I Was Dead.&quot; \nOn the 2006 re-release of Speak and Spell it was placed at the end of the album, \nwith the original U.K. tracklist preceding it.\n\n7&quot;: Mute / 7Mute13 (UK) &amp; CD: Mute / CDMute13\n\n   1. &quot;Dreaming of Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:46\n   2. &quot;Ice Machine&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54\n\n\n\nNEW LIFE\n\n&quot;New Life&quot; is the second UK single by Depeche Mode, originally released on June \n13, 1981. It was not commercially released in the United States.\n\nThere were two versions of the song available. The 7&quot; version would later become \nthe &quot;album version,&quot; as it would eventually appear on the UK version of Speak \nand Spell, released in October of 1981, and a 12&quot; &quot;remix,&quot; which differs from \nthe &quot;album version&quot; in that it has a different intro, and an added synth part in \nthe &quot;solo&quot; vocal section in the middle of the song, which is not present on the \n7&quot; mix. The &quot;remix&quot; would later appear on the US version of Speak and Spell.\n\nThe single became Depeche Mode's breakthrough hit in the UK, peaking at #11. On \nJune 25, 1981, the band performed &quot;New Life&quot; during their debut appearance on \nthe BBC's &quot;Top of the Pops.&quot; The band would perform the song twice more on the \nshow, on July 16 and July 30 of 1981.\n\nThe B-Side, &quot;Shout!&quot;, is the first Depeche Mode song to get a 12&quot; extended \nremix, called the &quot;Rio Mix.&quot; This mix would later appear on the remix \ncompilation Remixes 81 - 04 released in 2004. It is the earliest recorded song \navailable on the compilation.\n\nThese are the formats and track listings of major single releases of &quot;New Life&quot;:\n\n7&quot;: Mute / 7Mute14 (UK)\n\n   1. &quot;New Life&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43\n   2. &quot;Shout!&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44\n\n12&quot;: Mute / 12Mute14 (UK)\n\n   1. &quot;New Life (Remix)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:58\n   2. &quot;Shout!

It was also the band's first single to be released \nin the United States, on February 18, 1982. The song, a riff-driven Synthpop \npiece, was the final single to be written by Vince Clarke who left the band in \nDecember of 1981. He was inspired by Spandau Ballet's debut hit &quot;To Cut a Long \nStory Short.&quot; The song would be included on the band's first album, Speak and \nSpell, which was released a month after the single.\n\nThe single version of &quot;Just Can't Get Enough&quot; is the same version that appears \non the UK version of Speak and Spell. The &quot;Schizo Mix&quot; is an extended version \nwith a different intro and an ambient tune popping up after the choruses. It \nappears on the US version of Speak and Spell, the UK rerelease of Speak and \nSpell, the rerelease of The Singles (81-85) and Remixes 81 - 04.\n\nIn addition, the single's B-side &quot;Any Second Now&quot; was the first commercially \navailable Depeche Mode instrumental. It shows up on the UK rerelease of Speak \nand Spell. A version including vocals (the first Depeche Mode vocals to be \nhandled by Martin Gore) would appear on the album as &quot;Any Second Now (Voices)&quot;. \nThere is also an extended version, the &quot;Altered&quot; Mix. In the United States, the \nB-side is &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;. On the Speak and Spell album, the song is \ncrossfaded with the previous track, &quot;Photographic&quot;, but on the single, the \nintroduction is clean.\n\nThe single reached #8 on the UK Singles Chart and #26 on the US Hot Dance \nMusic/Club Play chart, making it their highest-charting single at the time on \nboth counts. It also became the band's first (and biggest) hit in Australia, \nreaching #4.\n\n&quot;Just Can't Get Enough&quot; is also the first Depeche Mode song to get a music \nvideo. It is the only DM video with Vince Clarke. The director was Clive \nRichardson.\n\nIt was used in Son of Rambow.\n\nIn 1997 the Happy hardcore DJ Duo Charly Lownoise and Mental Theo released the \nsong as single.\n\nOn September 12, 1999, premiered a Gap advertising spot directed by Pedro \nRomhanyi, titled &quot;Everybody in Leather&quot;, in which &quot;Just Can't Get Enough&quot; was \nsung by a group of young adults, among which were then-unknowns Alex Greenwald, \nMonet Mazur and Jason Thompson but only one familiar face in the group, Aaron \nLohr, the music mix being done by the Dust Brothers.[2]. On October 7, 1999, The \nTonight Show with Jay Leno did a parody of the ad, which featured old men \nsinging the song for a fictional Viagra ad.[3]\n\nIn 2004, the French band Nouvelle Vague adapted the song in a jazzy / bossa-nova \nstyle on the album, Nouvelle Vague (as well as on the 2005 compilation album, \nAcoustic 05). Japanese musician Anna Tsuchiya covered this song on her 2007 \nsingle Kuroi Namida except it is re-arranged as a downbeat rock piece.\n\nIt was used in a promotion for the now-defunct ITV Day morning-afternoon service \nbetween 2003-5. The cover by Nouvelle Vague has been widely used as background \nmusic on British television, including being used as the theme for BBC One's \nChristmas promotions in 2004.\n\nSpanish artist Marta SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡nchez sampled this song on her 2007 single &quot;Superstar&quot;.\n\nThis song is used in trailers for the film Music and Lyrics.\n\nThe song featured in the Mary-Kate and Ashley film, Winning London.\n\nIn an episode of Wayside, the background music put while Todd completes Mr. \nKidswatter's list sounds identical to the song.\n\nParts of the song were used in commercials for TV Land's reality show High \nSchool Reunion.\n\nThe song was used in the 1982 movie Summer Lovers.\n\nThis song was covered by girlband The Saturdays for British charity telethon \nComic Relief.\n\nThese are the formats and track listings of major single releases of &quot;Just Can't \nGet Enough&quot;:\n\n7&quot;: Mute/7Mute16 (UK)\n\n   1. &quot;Just Can't Get Enough&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:41\n   2. &quot;Any Second Now&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:06\n\n12&quot;: Mute/12Mute16 (UK)\n\n   1. &quot;Just Can't Get Enough (Schizo Mix)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:43\n   2. &quot;Any Second Now (Altered)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:41\n\nCD: Mute/CDMute16 (UK)1\n\n   1. &quot;Just Can't Get Enough&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45\n   2. &quot;Any Second Now&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:09\n   3. &quot;Just Can't Get Enough (Schizo Mix)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:48\n   4. &quot;Any Second Now (Altered)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:42\n\n7&quot;: Sire/SRE50029 (US)\n\n   1. &quot;Just Can't Get Enough&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:41\n   2. &quot;Tora!

Not great quality, but take it as just a very little extra.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                      IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ (A REQUEST)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt's usual to post comments only to complain about a torrent which doesn't work \nin your configuration.  It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and \nexpecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and \nexpressing this is legitimate.\n\nI've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ \npeople, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading \nand therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, \nbut to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused \ntools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for\nfree.\n\nIF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING \nA LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent \nalive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is\nreached.\n\nThanks\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f29ad81335c36023f27d80148e0f241382da8a16","amp;dn":"Depeche+Mode+-+Speak+%26+Spell+%28Bonus+Tracks%29++%5BDVDRip%5D+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f29ad81335c36023f27d80148e0f241382da8a16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,154,216,19,53,195,96,35,242,125,128,20,142,15,36,19,130,218,138,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
