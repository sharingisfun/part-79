A colorful breath of fresh sound waves that delivers strategic blows to your eardrums via high end production and well played vocals.\n\nThis is a new wave genre of music with a playful fan base and they are taking the industry by storm one track at a time. Self described as a potent strain of alternative hip hop, The New F-OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s are similar to hip-hop and alternative artists like Shwayze, Outkast and Red Hot Chili Peppers but with a truly unique flavor of their own.\n\nThis hybrid type of lyrical duo seems to captivate your attention by leaving each venue and crowd wanting more and feeling good hence the name of their newly released EP ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œReal Life Feel Good.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\nThis torrent was created and uploaded with the express permission of the New F-O's to be shared freely with other fans. Remember to seed and keep the Real Life Feel Good flowing.\n\nPeace.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b2989b303544b1efec976ba4b10d5ee8ae0e202","amp;dn":"The+New+F-O%5C%27s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b2989b303544b1efec976ba4b10d5ee8ae0e202","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,41,137,179,3,84,75,30,254,201,118,186,75,16,213,238,138,224,226,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
