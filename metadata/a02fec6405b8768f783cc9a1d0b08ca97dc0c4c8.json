No other program can do this.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ VueScan can scan while the user is editing a previous scan with Photoshop. All the other programs use TWAIN or plug-ins, which don't allow this.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ VueScan is the only program that works with multiple vendor's scanners for a single purchase price.    \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ VueScan can do scans that produce more than 2 GBytes of data.\n\nVueScan and SilverFast are the two leading multi-vendor scanner programs. Some differences are:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Supported scanners - VueScan supports 1200 scanners and SilverFast supports 289 scanners.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Supported languages - VueScan supports 40 languages and SilverFast supports 7 languages.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Universal Binary - VueScan runs faster on Intel Macs because it is a universal binary. Silverfast is an older PowerPC program that runs slower on Intel Macs (it has a universal binary launcher, but the SilverFast plugin is PowerPC only).\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Multi-processor - VueScan runs faster on multi-processor systems (including multi-core systems) on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Silverfast doesn't have multi-processor support and is slower.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Number of scanners - a single copy of VueScan can work with all supported scanners, but you need to purchase and install a separate copy of SilverFast for each scanner you use.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Cost - VueScan Standard Edition costs $39.95 and Professional Edition costs $79.95. SilverFast SE costs $39.95 and SilverFast Ai costs up to $424.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Upgrades - VueScan Standard Edition includes one year of free upgrades and VueScan Professional Edition includes unlimited free upgrades. SilverFast upgrades can cost up to $304.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Film scanning - VueScan is widely acknowledged to produce superior scans of color negative film\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Infrared cleaning - VueScan supports on all scanners with an infrared lamp, SilverFast doesn't support on any Canon scanners and on some Epson scanners.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 2 GByte scans - VueScan can do high-resolution scans that produce more than 2 GBytes of scan data, SilverFast can't. This is useful when scanning 4x5 or 8x10 film.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Ease of use - VueScan has a simpler, more consistent user interface than SilverFast, and is easier to learn, easier to use, and more productive for batch scanning.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a02fec6405b8768f783cc9a1d0b08ca97dc0c4c8","amp;dn":"VueScan+8+5+24+0+Pro+Full","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a02fec6405b8768f783cc9a1d0b08ca97dc0c4c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,47,236,100,5,184,118,143,120,60,201,161,208,176,140,169,125,192,196,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
