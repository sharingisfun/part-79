Create an account once it prompts you to, and start to play. You will then have to install all of the patches though.\n\nI will seed this all night and sometime during the daylight hours. So don't forget to seed!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e14855988c57e940a2d5c1e5e9f20eb12a8395ff","amp;dn":"World+of+Warcraft+%26+All+Expansions+%28ISO%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e14855988c57e940a2d5c1e5e9f20eb12a8395ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,72,85,152,140,87,233,64,162,213,193,229,233,242,14,177,42,131,149,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
