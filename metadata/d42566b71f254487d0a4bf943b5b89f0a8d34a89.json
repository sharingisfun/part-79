He finds himself the lone Christmas day mission over war-torn Bosnia. But, when he talks pilot Stackhouse into flying slightly off-course to check out an interesting target, the two get shot down. Burnett is soon alone, trying to outrun a pursuing army, while commanding officer Reigert finds his rescue operation hamstrung by politics, forcing Burnett to run far out of his way.\n\nGenres: Action / Drama / Thriller / War\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d42566b71f254487d0a4bf943b5b89f0a8d34a89","amp;dn":"Behind+Enemy+Lines.1080p.AC+3%28DD%29.5.1ch.Blu-ra+y.PS3-TEAM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d42566b71f254487d0a4bf943b5b89f0a8d34a89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,37,102,183,31,37,68,135,208,164,191,148,59,91,137,240,168,211,74,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
