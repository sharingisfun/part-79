Bear Family now presents for the first time all the Texas Troubadours instrumentals on one collection, tracks that were previously available only on vinyl or within the third and fourth Ernest Tubb box sets! There are several steel guitar instrumentals by the phenomenal Buddy Emmons, and then features an amazing array of musical pyrotechnics from the great team of Leon Rhodes and Buddy Charleton. If you're a fan of Speedy West and Jimmy Bryant, these recordings are the neutronic 1960s version of Speedy and Jimmy's 1940s atomic power! 36 tracks. Bear Family.\n\n\nDepending on how well this torrent does, I may upload an EAC Flac version.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f6c55b8f36fbcdaff852961c3d3a1e97d3b9b95","amp;dn":"Almost+to+Tulsa+-+The+Texas+Troubadours","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f6c55b8f36fbcdaff852961c3d3a1e97d3b9b95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,108,85,184,243,111,188,218,255,133,41,97,195,211,161,233,125,59,155,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
