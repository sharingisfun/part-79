Fully loaded she displaces 97,000 tons, boasts a four-and-a-half-acre flight deck that is as long as the Empire State Building is tall, and is run by nuclear reactors that can go twenty years without refueling.\n\nHow does such a mind-boggling vessel rise up out of molten steel? Witness every critical step in the construction of the USS Harry S. Truman. Time-lapse filming at Newport News Shipbuilding captures this seven-year odyssey from computer models to final fittings. Learn how engineers, machinists, construction supervisors, and others bring hundreds of subsystems together under infinitely precise requirements. Finally, stand alongside top brass for Truman's grueling sea trials to learn if she will prove herself worthy to join her sister supercarriers of the U.S. Navy.\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Roy Scheider\n-------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle: City Of Steel-Carrier\nYear:  2001\nFile Size: 347 MB \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:52:02\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Resolution: 576x352\nVIdeo Bitrate:  1016 kbit/s\nFPS:  23.976000\nAudio Bitrate: 98 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: MPEG Layer-3\nChannels:  2 \nSubtitles: (N/A)\n\n\n\n\nIMDB: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1466342/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1466342/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at   \n\nthis link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\nTips:For better background view chance the &quot;Style Chooser&quot; at the bottom left \ncorner to &quot;graphite_x&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:965fa20a0750788eb46363ab740a796fcd131a64","amp;dn":"City+Of+Steel-Carrier-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"965fa20a0750788eb46363ab740a796fcd131a64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,95,162,10,7,80,120,142,180,99,99,171,116,10,121,111,205,19,26,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
