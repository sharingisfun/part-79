Experience the hot licks and scissor kicks that\n       made Van Halen the legends they are today. 25 epic Van Halen tracks,\n       three scorching Eddie Van Halen signature solos, and 19 guest acts\n       give fans the most comprehensive arena rock set list to date.\n\n       With over 80 million albums sold worldwide, Van Halen is one of the\n       most influential rock bands of all time. Led by Eddie Van Halen's\n       revolutionary guitar playing and David Lee Roth's unique brand of\n       showmanship, the band has cemented their place in the Rock 'N Roll\n       Hall of Fame since they dropped their self-titled album in 1978. Van\n       Halen is one of only five rock bands that have had two albums sell\n       more than 10 million copies in the United States.\n\n       Best Arena Rock Set List To Date!\n\n       Van Halen:\n\n       * Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love\n       * And The Cradle Will Rock\n       * Atomic Punk\n       * Beautiful Girls\n       * Cathedral (Solo)\n       * Dance The Night Away\n       * Eruption (Solo)\n       * Everybody Wants Some!!\n       * Feel Your Love Tonight\n       * Hang 'Em High\n       * Hear About It Later\n       * Hot For Teacher\n       * I'm The One\n       * Ice Cream Man\n       * Jamie's Cryin'\n       * Jump\n       * Little Guitars\n       * Loss Of Control\n       * Mean Street\n       * Panama\n       * Pretty Woman\n       * Romeo Delight\n       * Runnin' With The Devil\n       * So This Is Love?\n       * Somebody Get Me A Doctor\n       * Spanish Fly\n       * Unchained\n       * You Really Got\n\n       Guest Acts:\n\n       * Alter Bridge ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» Come To Life\n       * Billy Idol ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» White Wedding\n       * Blink-182 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» First Date\n       * The Clash ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» Safe European Home\n       * Deep Purple ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» Space Truckin'\n       * Foo Fighters ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» Best Of You\n       * Foreigner ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» Double Vision\n       * Fountains of Wayne ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» Stacy's Mom\n       * Jimmy Eat World ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» Pain\n       * Judas Priest ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» Painkiller\n       * Killswitch Engage ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» The End Of Heartache\n       * Lenny Kravitz ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» Rock And Roll Is Dead\n       * Queen ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» I Want It All\n       * Queens of the Stone Age ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» Sick, Sick, Sick\n       * Tenacious D ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» Master Exploder\n       * The Offspring ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» Pretty Fly (For A White Guy)\n       * Third Eye Blind ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» Semi-Charmed Life\n       * Weezer ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» Dope Nose\n       * Yellowcard ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» The Takedown\n\n    ____________________________________________________________________ _ _\n   +-RELEASE.NOTES\n\n       Playable Regions: ALL (REGION-FREE)\n\n       Works with Lips mics!\n\n       Verified with abgx360\n\n       Two and a half months early?!?
