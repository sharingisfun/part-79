Who does that?! Rasputina--that's who.) EP by Rasputina called The Willow Tree Triptych. It consists of 3 songs named &quot;The Willow Tree&quot;:\n\n   1. American 2:27\n   2. English 2:34\n   3. Irish 4:03\n\nI wish that I could have bought this album, seeing as I'm a rabid Rasputina fan, but the world's population minus one hundred people will have to make do with this. Please enjoy, I know I do.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d76205b0f218a6c2072b5fcb54d8e9320a4ea1d","amp;dn":"Rasputina+-+The+Willow+Tree+Triptych","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d76205b0f218a6c2072b5fcb54d8e9320a4ea1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,118,32,91,15,33,138,108,32,114,181,252,181,77,142,147,32,164,234,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
