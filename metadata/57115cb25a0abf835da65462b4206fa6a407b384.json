The focus of this project is to make the ultimate design and ride package with features found in high end CAD software, offering unprecedented power and control over the coaster building process. &quot;&quot;Hyper Rails&quot;&quot; gives all the advanced features the serious coaster enthusiast will be looking for while allowing beginners to easily create complex designs. HR has a spline based track editor which gives users control over position, heading, pitch, roll and tension of each track segment via control points. Players now have the ability to pull, bend, stretch and twist track pieces into any shape, allowing for the creation of real life scale replicas or custom designs. The editor also has many features that aid in the design process, helpful to new coaster builders.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57115cb25a0abf835da65462b4206fa6a407b384","amp;dn":"hyper-Rails-1-0.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57115cb25a0abf835da65462b4206fa6a407b384","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,17,92,178,90,10,191,131,93,166,84,98,180,32,111,166,164,7,179,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
