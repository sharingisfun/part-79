For centuries, this region has been known for its sugar cane production, as well as for the existing hunger and poverty. The monoculture of sugar cane concentrates land, income and power. The production went into crisis in the 90s and many producers went into debt and dismissed their workers. Without any other job opportunities or any land to produce food, 280 families decided to occupy in 1997 various uncultivated plots of the sugar plantation Prado, in the municipality of TracunhaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©m, State of  Pernambuco.\nThe State of Brazil, through INCRA (National Institute for Colonisation and Agrarian Reform) which is in charge of the implementation of the agrarian reform - confirmed that the plots lied idle and that in compliance with the Brazilian law the government should expropriate the land for agrarian reform. However, the Joao Santos group, the owners of the land, appealed against this decree, which led to a suspension of the expropriation, until very recently.\n\nIn November 2003, the situation of the families changed drastically when the authorities of Pernambuco, with the assistance of police and private security personnel of landowners evicted the families from the land, destroying crops, houses, killing animals, and humiliating the families in many ways. Since November 2003, the families had been camped out along the road. Men, women, children and old people were living in plastic huts, without access to land and prevented from producing their food, depending on private and government donations. In June 2004 a fact finding mission of FIAN and Via Campesina (LVC) was carried out in the context of the Global Campaign for Agrarian Reform and verified the inhuman living conditions of these families, met with public officials to denounce this situation and find a solution for the respect of those families' human rights.\nAfter a seven year struggle, the expropriation was depending on the highest authority of the Brazilian legal system. It was hoped that the Supreme Federal Court would speed up its decision as promised by its president when he met with the fact finding mission of FIAN and La Via Campesina in June 2004. Finally, on the 29th of June 2005, the Brazilian Supreme Court decided in favour of the families and expropriated definitively the Joao Santos group from the land of &quot;Engenho Prado&quot;. In November 2005, the Brazilian Supreme Court finally expropriated &quot;Engenho Prado&quot; land in favour of 280 landless families.\n&quot;We obtained our land to cultivate. I can't believe it. We got older because of the struggle for land but our sons will be able to produce here without any fear of persecution. That's why I am happy.&quot;\nThis was certainly a victory by the peasant families, in which FIAN played an important supportive role.\nHowever the struggle continues. FIAN has recently received information that the families are still living in plastic huts, without access to electricity, clean water and inputs, because the Brazilian government has not fulfilled its legal commitments to provide credit for infrastructure, housing and production. More serious though, is that a leadership was murdered in June 2007 and the families continue to receive death threats.\nFIAN International has launched a new initiative to demand the protection and promotion of the human right to adequate food and related rights of the Engenho Prado families.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i471.photobucket.com/albums/rr71/albert88_photo/snapshot20100512211615.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i471.photobucket.com/albums/rr71/albert88_photo/snapshot20100512211615.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i471.photobucket.com/albums/rr71/albert88_photo/snapshot20100512211528.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i471.photobucket.com/albums/rr71/albert88_photo/snapshot20100512211528.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i471.photobucket.com/albums/rr71/albert88_photo/snapshot20100512211455.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i471.photobucket.com/albums/rr71/albert88_photo/snapshot20100512211455.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i471.photobucket.com/albums/rr71/albert88_photo/snapshot20100512211323.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i471.photobucket.com/albums/rr71/albert88_photo/snapshot20100512211323.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i471.photobucket.com/albums/rr71/albert88_photo/snapshot20100512211950.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i471.photobucket.com/albums/rr71/albert88_photo/snapshot20100512211950.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3f1dad69cd633fadc62409847db78bf14ece5de","amp;dn":"Engenho+Prado+-+Guerra+de+baixa+intensidade+na+Zona+da+Mata+Nort","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3f1dad69cd633fadc62409847db78bf14ece5de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,241,218,214,156,214,51,250,220,98,64,152,71,219,120,191,20,236,229,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
