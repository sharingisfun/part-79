Rockfort Rock\n\nErnest Ranglin\n2.  Ball O'Fire\n3.  King Tubby Meets The Rockers\n4.  ?\n5.  Satta Massagana\n6.  ?\n7.  ?\n8.  Nana's Chalk Pipe\n9.  ?\n10. Surfin'\n11. Below The Bassline \n\nTotal \n\n\n\n\nA great way to kick off the festival. Cool music from the good Dr, and a lot of fun along the way. It won't be \nobvious from listening, but Ernie was playing games on his fretboard during his tunes, showing how dexterous he\nstill is. It's hard to believe that this highly respected man is now 75 years of age, and he sure does still\nenjoy what he's doing. \n\nAny help finishing off the setlist would be much appreciated.\n\nI'm afraid I gave my positioning for the recording little or no thought - I was at the festival to have a good time,\nand spent most of the time dancing right at the front. As a result, the sound quality might have been a bit better,\nbut I think it still turned out pretty well all things considered.\n\nFirst seeded at Reggae Lossless Traders 4 Dec 07.\n\nHope you like it, share freely, and don't forget to go and see some live reggae!! Oh, and please don't encode to mp3 \nunless it's for your personal use only.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1037164aa376bfb31c5edb3a9da397bf39b2feb7","amp;dn":"er2007-11-24bosssounds","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1037164aa376bfb31c5edb3a9da397bf39b2feb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,55,22,74,163,118,191,179,28,94,219,58,157,163,151,191,57,178,254,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
