Quite a good australian comedy/drama movie from the 80's. Anyone who likes The Matrix Trilogy will recognise &quot;The Trainman&quot; as &quot;Ted&quot;, the always-drunk, never-helping guy lol.\n\nHope you enjoy. If anyone finds a DVD copy please post in comments. I cannot find it at any of my normal stores Ezydvd or Dstore.\n\nPretty good quality for VHS. I provide this as currently I know of no way to buy this movie, and they haven't shown it on television as rerun for probably 10 years. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img25.imageshack.us/img25/598/buddiesy.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img25.imageshack.us/img25/598/buddiesy.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085278/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085278/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:081a2253ed3113febe78039397effaf2f932864f","amp;dn":"Buddies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"081a2253ed3113febe78039397effaf2f932864f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,26,34,83,237,49,19,254,190,120,3,147,151,239,250,242,249,50,134,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
