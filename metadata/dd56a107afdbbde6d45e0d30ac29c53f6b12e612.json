The accompanying PowerPoint slides and video should also be available online.\n\nVisit: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.localfuture.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.localfuture.org&lt;/a&gt;\nhttp://www.aaronwissner.com\n\nBio\n\n\nAaron Wissner is a public school educator of seventeen years and founder of Local Future educational nonprofit.
