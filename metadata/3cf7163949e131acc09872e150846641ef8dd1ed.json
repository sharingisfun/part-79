I hope our generation take from this raw individuals as much wisdom as they can. I cant find words to explain the lost of Howard for the world but I think he also left us soo much, that we can look with hope in the future, as howard did it always and would have expected from us.\n\n..theArchit3kt..\n\n\n! keep this torrents alive !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cf7163949e131acc09872e150846641ef8dd1ed","amp;dn":"About+Howard+Zinn+-+%2A24+August+1922+%3B+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%C2%A0+27+Januar+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cf7163949e131acc09872e150846641ef8dd1ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,247,22,57,73,225,49,172,192,152,114,225,80,132,102,65,239,141,209,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
