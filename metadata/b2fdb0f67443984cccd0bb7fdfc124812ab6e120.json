The others are personal favorites of mine from the past ten years of music making.\nMy style is experimental, down-tempo, happy-house. Some songs are more instrumental orchestrations. These are all original compositions by me. Gear used includes TB-303 emulation, SH-101, FR-777, MS2000, and a long list of software. Cubase Studio 4 is my host, run on a Q9650 Intel.\nI am located in Nevada City, California, USA.
