A maverick musical genius who wrote and recorded a string of number one hits in the early 60s, Meek famously enjoyed phenomenal early success with Telstar ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the biggest selling record of its time and the first Brit band single to top the US charts. Named after the first communications satellite, which launched in 1962, the unique instrumental single was released later that same year, becoming a number one hit on both sides of the Atlantic for MeekÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s band The Tornados, all from a flat on the Holloway Road. Meek went on to create the strange and wonderful recordings that have made him an iconic figure in the world of British pop, until depression, heartbreak and paranoia ultimately led to his dramatic downfall.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1068669/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1068669/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://moviefox.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://moviefox.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f2f7baa87f10c306aeeec61a44a1a00b420c2ea","amp;dn":"Telstar.LiMiTED.DVDRip.XviD-DoNE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f2f7baa87f10c306aeeec61a44a1a00b420c2ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,47,123,170,135,241,12,48,106,238,236,97,164,74,26,0,180,32,194,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
