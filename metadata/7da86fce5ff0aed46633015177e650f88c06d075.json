During the encore, parts of the set began to grow and sprout leaves. This stage setup was used for this show only, and disappeared for the rest of the run. Before Sleep, FishmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s drum kit was moved to allow the crew to roll out a small mini-stage with a scaled-down drum set and a baby grand piano. Trey and Mike sat on stools and both played acoustic guitars. This acoustic set-up was used for Sleep, Albuquerque, and Driver. During the WolfmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s jam, three people in inchworm-like costumes came on stage and danced for the rest of the set.\n\nSource: Schoeps CMC641 &gt; Lunatec V2 &gt; Apogee AD1000 &gt; DAT","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7da86fce5ff0aed46633015177e650f88c06d075","amp;dn":"1998-12-28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7da86fce5ff0aed46633015177e650f88c06d075","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,168,111,206,95,240,174,212,102,51,1,81,119,230,80,248,140,6,208,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
