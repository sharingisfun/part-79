A ten minute epic journey through the dark woods of the western part of Sweden in the cosy song &quot;VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤st&quot; to the more uptempo almost dubsteppish track &quot;ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€œst&quot;. The man behind the project, Rikard JÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶nsson, recently got interviewed by Q Magazine where he talked about his influences and where he's heading next: &quot;During my many journeys around the country do I find the most comfortable workspace for creating my music is on trains. Just to look at the transforming landscape really gives me the inspiration I need. I am really hoping that I can continue this kind of traveling in the rest of the world since a tour in Japan is coming up very soon!&quot;. \n\nMany critics agrees, this boy will go far. Everyone from fans of Radiohead to Burial and Mogwai might be in the zone to finding this music very pleasant as well as fans of post rock acts such as Godspeed You! Black Emperor and This Is Your Captain Speaking. Earlier works of this young talent has included a very distorted cover of the band Portishead and their song Roads, a cover so interesting and important that the band itself actually posted a link to it on their official myspace page.\n\nDon't be surprised if ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¦bÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ke comes to a town near you to give you some pleasant moments very soon. Until then, stay tuned for more releases!\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:148717ff3b88336ba2d9be3425326ee15420dc41","amp;dn":"%C3%83%E2%80%A6b%C3%83%C2%A4ke+-+%C3%83%C2%B6st%2Fv%C3%83%C2%A4st+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"148717ff3b88336ba2d9be3425326ee15420dc41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,135,23,255,59,136,51,107,162,217,190,52,37,50,110,225,84,32,220,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
