The band was booked under the name Volsung and were said to be a small band from Norway. \n\n*There were only 2,100 audience members making it a very intimate evening for those fortunate enough to be there. \n\n*This was the ninth time that Metallica played Austin, TX. The first time they played Austin was on August 24, 1983 at The Nightlife. \n\n*The last time Metallica played Austin was on September 3, 2004 on the Madly in Anger With the World tour and was the only city to see the song Sweet Amber performed live. \n\n*It was the first time in almost 15 years that Harvester of Sorrow, Welcome Home (Sanitarium), Breadfan, and Whiplash were performed in Austin. They were last played here on August 6, 1994 on the Summer Sh*t tour.\n\nTracklist: \n\n01 Creeping Death \n02 For Whom The Bell Tolls \n03 Harvester Of Sorrow \n04 One \n05 Broken, Beat and Scarred \n06 Cyanide \n07 Sad But True \n08 Welcome Home (Sanitarium) \n09 Master Of Puppets \n10 Blackened \n11 Breadfan \n12 Whiplash \n13 Seek And Destroy\n\nmp3   128kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd196744df5c946316ca49340c887ed99bdb5e58","amp;dn":"Metallica+-+Live+In+Austin%2C+Texas+%2820-03-09%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd196744df5c946316ca49340c887ed99bdb5e58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,25,103,68,223,92,148,99,22,202,73,52,12,136,126,217,155,219,94,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
