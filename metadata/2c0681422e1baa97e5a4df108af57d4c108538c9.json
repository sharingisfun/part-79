He was\ncrowned King of Scotland January 1651 and King of England\nApril 1651.\n\nThere was an effusion of baroque music, bawdy plays, scientific\nprogress, new architecture, and entertainments - The Restoration.\nBut how much was really restored, how much was new, and how much\nhad never gone away?\n\n\nThere was also dancing in the streets, not so much for having the\nmonarchy back, but rather, because it was the beginning of the end\n[in England anyway] for puritanism and the Solemn League and Covenant.\n\nScotland had to wait a bit longer. But even here, just 350 years on,\napart from in the outer islands, the power of The Kirk to impose\nsocial conformity is now dead. \n\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c0681422e1baa97e5a4df108af57d4c108538c9","amp;dn":"BBC+R3+Documentary+-+%5C%27The+King+Returned%5C%27+sp7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c0681422e1baa97e5a4df108af57d4c108538c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,6,129,66,46,27,170,151,229,164,223,16,138,245,125,76,16,133,56,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
