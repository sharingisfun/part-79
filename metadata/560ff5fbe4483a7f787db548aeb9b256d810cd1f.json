Mary\n\n\n  ================ \n Finally the Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â³ber talented twins Johanna and Miriam Eriksson Berhan from Stockholm,\n Sweden are ready to release their debut full-length album Still Standing at Your Back Door.\n As Taxi Taxi!, they have already spellbound thousands of listeners since their very first\n upload to Myspace in 2005 (aged 15!) and later on with their two EPs Taxi Taxi! (2007)\n and Step Out Into The Light (2009) and their many concerts across Europe and at\n festivals like Roskilde and Hultsfred. \n\n They write brilliant songs and sing them out so mesmerizingly sweet, that it is hard\n to believe these two remarkable girls were born not before 1990. Their new album is\n full of heartwarming and honest songs - some gentle and magical - some uplifting and\n spine-tingling beautiful. When Johanna and Miriam sing together there is a charming\n almost breathtaking sensibility present. Same time when listening you get the clear\n vision of two very brave adolescents singing their hearts out.\n\n Still Standing at Your Back Door is an astonishing achivement. Taxi Taxi! have managed\n to make a youthful album but with incredible mature taste.\n Taxi Taxi! have been in good hands while making the album. Still Standing at\n Your Back Door is produced by Johan Berthling (member of Tape and co-owner of the\n magnificent HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âµpna label) and mixed by Joachim Ekerman (Jenny Wilson, Frida HyvÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â·nen,\n First Floor Power). Taxi Taxi! sing and play almost every instrument on the album\n themselves, but the album also features strings, brass and percussion played by a\n select handful of fine guest musicians from the Stockholm scene.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:560ff5fbe4483a7f787db548aeb9b256d810cd1f","amp;dn":"Taxi%21+Taxi%21-Still+Standing+At+Your+Backdoor+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"560ff5fbe4483a7f787db548aeb9b256d810cd1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,15,245,251,228,72,58,127,120,125,181,72,174,185,178,86,216,16,205,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
