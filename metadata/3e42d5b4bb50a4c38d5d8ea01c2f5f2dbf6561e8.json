Avoiding friends, the only way for her to  \n cope with her depression is by composing beautiful      \n poetry. On her way to a convention in Oakland, she is   \n forced to ride with an independent-minded postal worker \n whom she has not gotten along with in the past. After   \n various arguments between them and their friends, they  \n start to discover that their thoughts on violence,      \n socially and domestically, are the same.
