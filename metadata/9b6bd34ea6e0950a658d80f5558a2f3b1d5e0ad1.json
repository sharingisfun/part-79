But the scrolls were soon embroiled in controversy with allegations of conspiracy and cover-up, rumours that persist today thanks to The Da Vinci Code.\n\n \nMost people have heard of the scrolls, but what do they actually contain? On the eve of the 60th anniversary of their discovery Rageh Omaar tells the remarkable story of the Dead Sea Scrolls and uncovers the truth behind the myth, discovering that their story is far from over.\n\n \n\nTechnical Specs: \n\nVideo Bitrate: 2147 KB/s\nVideo Codec: XviD\nResolution: 688 x 384\nAspect Ratio: 1.79:1\nFramerate: 25 FPS (133427 Frames)\nQuality Factor: 0.325 B/px\nAudio Bitrate: 192 KB/s (CBR)\nAudio Codec: MP3\nChannels: 2 @ Sampling Rate: 48 kHz\nSubs: (TVCap =&gt;) NO\nTotal Size: 1.45 GB (1/3rd of DVD5)\nLength: 01:28:57\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b6bd34ea6e0950a658d80f5558a2f3b1d5e0ad1","amp;dn":"The+Dead+Sea+Scrolls+%28BBC+2006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b6bd34ea6e0950a658d80f5558a2f3b1d5e0ad1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,107,211,78,166,224,149,10,101,141,128,245,85,138,47,59,29,94,10,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
