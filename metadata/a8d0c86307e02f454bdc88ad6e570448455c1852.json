Two years have past since disaster struck the Vivio family, when a bridge over their creek collapsed, damaging the father Mark's right knee, which led him to discover a threatening heart problem. With injuries preventing him from working, Mark was forced to close his roofing business and take a job as his youngest son Elijah's school bus driver. With the events of the past year, Elijah is also headed towards an unhealthy downward spiral. Jillian must rally the Vivios around Elijah and reverse the damage that has been done.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8d0c86307e02f454bdc88ad6e570448455c1852","amp;dn":"Losing.It.With.Jillian.S01E05.HDTV.XviD-DeadDad.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8d0c86307e02f454bdc88ad6e570448455c1852","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,208,200,99,7,224,47,69,75,220,136,173,110,87,4,72,69,92,24,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
