Transcoding of multiple angles into a single video file is pointless, so now selection of multiple angles is disabled.\n- fix: Any lipsync issues sould be resolved now - please post any problems in the appropriate area at SlySoft Forum\n- change: after initial installation of CloneDVD mobile the default output folder is now changed to the user's &quot;My Documents&quot; directory to ensure write privileges are available.\n- fix: several profiles optimized.\n- several minor fixes and improvements\n- Updated languages\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af25062348a30f0b161b9558140cb0d1786b803e","amp;dn":"CloneDVD+Mobile+v.1.6.10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af25062348a30f0b161b9558140cb0d1786b803e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,37,6,35,72,163,15,11,22,27,149,88,20,12,176,209,120,107,128,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
