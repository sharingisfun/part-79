Team Galaxy chronicles the tales between Josh, Brett, and Yoko, three students who attend Galaxy High, the world's most renowned school for training Space Marshals. Accompanied by their robotic ultrapet Fluffy, the team travels to far out galaxies and defeat some of the weirdest villians this side of the Milky Way, all while juggling the daily duties of average teenage life. \n\n\nEpisode Information:\n\nThe very first Team Galaxy episode. A new student shows up at Galaxy High and immediately becomes popular with everyone there. The student happens to be a rebel like Josh, an A-plus student like Brett, and a multi-talented entertainer like Yoko. Though everyone at school (students and teachers alike) find the new student to be completely delightful, Yoko, on the other hand, is instantly suspicious of him. So much so, that she does everything in her power to expose the new marshal as a fraud. But each time, her plan backfires and Yoko is made to look like a jealous bad guy. Turns out, the new student is actually an evil alien assigned to infiltrate the school and disable the defense system. Will the team be able to save the school from the attacking alien forces? In a b-story, Yoko hosts the first ever Galaxy High Open Mic Talent. \n\nFile Information:\n\nFormat: MPEG2\nExcellent Video and Audio\nRecorded directly from TV, so short advertisement appears in middle of episode. Still very watchable.\n\nPlease Seed and Enjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dc89b1f1b86ae470df740d8f755d7d451f1b646","amp;dn":"Team+Galaxy+%231+-+The+New+Recruit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dc89b1f1b86ae470df740d8f755d7d451f1b646","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,200,155,31,27,134,174,71,13,247,64,216,247,85,215,212,81,241,182,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
