They are originally founded in The Hague, The Netherlands. The group consists of the two original members, Dinand Woesthoff (lead vocals) and Dennis van Leeuwen (guitar). Their music can be described as &quot;guitar rock&quot; and is inspired by U2. The group started to perform in 1998 for a small audience but soon got noticed by Edwin Jansen. Their breakthrough came with the album 'Where do I go' in 1999. Their latest released album was the live album recorded in de Kuip, Rotterdam.\n\nThis discography includes 10 albums and some extra's. There are also 5 DVD's in this torrent.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nAUDIO\n\nAs long as you want this (2000)\n\n1. As long as you want this\n2. Can you handle me\n3. Damn those eyes\n4. Hands\n5.
