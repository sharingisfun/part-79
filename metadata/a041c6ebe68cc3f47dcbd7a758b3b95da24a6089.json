The series is based on the book Leadbelly: Inside Australia's Underworld, by The Age journalists John Silvester and Andrew Rule.\n\nThis is the &quot;descriptive audio&quot; track from the Underbelly: Uncut DVD release. Caroline Craig, who plays detective Jacqui James, reads the stage and script directions between the original audio from the TV series.  This is as close as you'll get to an audiobook for this ground-breaking (and thoroughly awesome) Australian TV series.\n\nDVD audio ripped with TMPGEnc, converted to MP3 with dBPoweramp at 100kbs LAME joint-stereo.
