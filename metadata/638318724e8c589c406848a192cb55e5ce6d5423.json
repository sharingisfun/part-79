It was released on 13 April 2009.\n\nThe music video for the single premiered aton June 11, 2009. The video shows the band performing on a scene and in a studio. There are also shots of the band playing at a basketball court. Satriani made a joke about that the video would win many awards as &quot;best barbecue video&quot;.\n\nIn a video on the band's website, Joe Satriani said it was &quot;the typical Chickenfoot arrangement where the song starts out with a riff and the band kicks in, then going on all these changes and when the main riff starts again, the listeners have forgotten it because of the musical journey&quot;. He also told that it got started very simple with him and Sammy talking about old blues songs and artists, and that it would be great if they could fuse what they did naturally as a band with old blues songwriting.\n\nChickenfoot is an American hard rock band, comprising former Van Halen members Sammy Hagar (vocals) and Michael Anthony (bass), solo artist Joe Satriani (guitar) and Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith. The band released their eponymous debut album, Chickenfoot, on June 5, 2009. Regarding the band's status as a &quot;supergroup&quot;, vocalist Sammy Hagar states: &quot;WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not a supergroup, we like hanging out together and the music is a bonus. We just happen to be in other groups.&quot;\n\nWhile the band's name and logo reference a disparaging term used to describe the peace symbol, the &quot;footprint of the American chicken&quot;, bassist Michael Anthony asserts that the name originated from initial jam sessions between Hagar, Smith and himself: &quot;there are three talons on a chickenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s foot and there [were] three of us.&quot; \n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:638318724e8c589c406848a192cb55e5ce6d5423","amp;dn":"Chickenfoot+-+Oh+Yeah","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"638318724e8c589c406848a192cb55e5ce6d5423","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,131,24,114,78,140,88,156,64,104,72,161,146,203,85,229,206,109,84,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
