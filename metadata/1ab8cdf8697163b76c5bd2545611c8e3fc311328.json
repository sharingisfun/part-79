Pro Antivirus: Clean.\n\n4- Avira identifies OAF TrialReset v2.5A as a threat:\n   - Risk name: TR/Agent.720371 \t\n   - Risk type: Trojan\n\n3- Kaspersky Antivirus: Clean. \n\n\nThe av scan results are from May 22, 2010. \n\nThe av scan results of Norton and Avira are false positives due to some used \nbinaries and cryptors (or maybe OAF TR v2.5A is added to their virus database).\nSo just stay cool or don't use this!!!\n\nAlso scanned with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected \nby other anti-malware apps probably are false positives!\n\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n&gt; Intimidated by the AV Scan results &amp; scary names??? Then simply don't try this! &lt;\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\n\nGeneral info:\n*************\n\nOnline Armor TrialReset v2.5 gives an unlimited trial version \nof Online Armor Premium/Personal Firewall 4.0. \n  \n* It was tested on WinXP (x86)/Vista (x86)/Win7 (x86). \n* It may not work with the latest patches/updates.\n\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\n\n         Online Armor Premium/Personal Firewall 4.0.0.44 + TrialReset v2.5         \n\n\n\nIf you use online banking, buy things online, send and receive emails or just \nbrowse the internet then you're open to serious threats that your Antivirus \nSoftware just wasn't designed to stop. That's where Online Armor's Personal \nFirewall comes in.\n\nOnline Armor personal firewall protects your computer's internet connection \n(inbound connections and outbound connections), stops unknown programs from \nrunning and detects keyloggers, etc.\n\nOnline Armor is a full security system for your computer, offering 100% leak \nprotection right out of the box.\n\n\nAdjust the firewall settings precisely to your liking:\n\nIn standard mode most decisions are made completely automatically based on Online\nArmor's whitelist - meaning that you never need answer a complex firewall prompt \nagain.\n\n\nAdvanced mode, and additional options for power users are present.\n\nImport blacklists from Bluetak directly into the firewall and apply them against \nrules. This allows protection of P2P programs or web browsers, without applying \nthese lists against every connection. Filter web pages that you visit to remove \npotentially dangerous content.\n\nIf you perform transations online, Online Armor's banking mode protects you by \nonly allowing you to go to legitimate bank websites.\n\nOnline Armor also provides powerful protection against keystroke records and even \nfilters your email messages to weed out banking scams.\n\nYou can also use this feature to block countries or networks known to host malware,\nzombies or other dangerous content.\n\nIf you want to limit the connectivity of your computer to known systems (for \nexample, VNC to your home computer from the office network only) you can restrict\nit in Online Armor easily. You can also restrict connections by country (&quot;Don't \nallow connections to this country&quot;) or, alternatively, only open up certain \ncountries (&quot;Only allow my browser to connect to sites in the USA or Australia&quot;).\n\nOnline Armor includes powerful &quot;HIPS&quot; functions, which give you the ability to \nstop all unrecognised programs from running on your computer unless you say so, \nmaking it possible to protect yourself against these new attacks.\n\nPrograms Online Armor knows are safe will be allowed to run, no problem.\n\nThis is different to a pure Antivirus program - these let any program run, unless \nthey know it is a virus. This means that it must have that that exact threat in \nits database before it can do anything about it. Your antivirus will completely \nignore programs it does not recognise - which unfortunately includes new viruses.\n\n\nKey Features\n\n- Stops Hackers\n- Stops Malicious Programs\n- Protects you when Banking and Transacting Online\n- Protects your Identity\n- Light on Pop-ups\n- DoesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t slow down your PC\n- Identity Theft Protection\n- Online Banking Mode\n- Antivirus and Antimalware\n- Rootkit Scanner\n- Kernel Mode Security\n- Automatic Updates\n- Web Shield\n- Mail Shield\n- Phishing Filter\n- Execution Protection\n- Termination Protection\n- Prevent Spyware\n- Remove Spyware\n- DNS Checker\n- Hosts Checker\n- Firewall\n- Standard Mode\n- Advanced Mode\n- Keylogger Detection\n- Import/Export Settings\n- Tamper Protection\n- Transparent Blocking\n- DNS Spoofing Protection\n- Support\n- Script/Worm protection\n- Program Guard\n\n\nOverview Online Armor premium protection. \n\nEasy to use\nYou do not need a computer science degree to use Online Armor. The setup process \nis straightforward, and configuration is a one-time event and part of the initial \ninstallation process.\n\nLight on Pop-ups\nOnline Armor's aim is not to annoy you with too many messages and when it does \ngive you a message, there are clear options given on how to respond. \n\nDoesn't slow down your PC\nOnline Armor does not slow down your PC. \n\nPersonal Firewall\nOnline Armor's new personal firewall provides awesome protection from inbound \nthreats and complete control of data leaving your computer for the internet. \n\nOnline Banking Protection\nNever worry about banking online again. Online Armor's Banking mode is a standout \nfeature that locks down your session while you are doing your banking online.\n\nIdentity Theft Protection\nProbably the number one threat online; identity theft ruins lives. Online Armor \nprotects you from phishing and keylogging techniques that these criminals use. \n\nSafe Browsing\nThis allows you to lock down your online browsing sessions and protect yourself \nfrom malicious websites installing nasties on your machine. \n\nPrevent Spyware\nProgram Guard gives you control over which programs are allowed to run on your \ncomputer. Known safe programs don't harass you with popups, and dangerous \nprograms will give a red warning popup so you can prevent them from running. \n\nRemove Spyware\nIf spyware gets onto your computer - perhaps because you have accidentally \nallowed it, Online Armor will allow you to remove it. Unwanted extensions to \nInternet Explorer can be removed with a mouse-click. Unwanted programs can be \nblocked via Program Guard, or removed completely. \n\nDNS Checker\nThis stops programs from manipulating your Windows settings to misdirect you to \nfake sites. \n\nHosts Checker\nSimilar to the DNS Check, Online Armor checks your HOSTS file and alerts you if \nanything changes. The hosts file can also be used to make your web browser visit \nsites other than the one you intended. \n\nAutoruns Management\nAllows you to control which programs start automatically with your computer. \nThis can be used to help defeat spyware (it must start sometime) as well as \noptimize your computer's performance. \n\nTamper Protection\nMalicious programs are getting tougher and tougher and often attack other \nprograms (including security programs) to do their nasty deeds. Online Armor's \nProgram Guard guards not only itself against tampering, but protection other \nprograms from malicious code. \n\nKeylogger Detection\nOnline Armor protects your passwords and private information from being stolen \nby blocking the keylogger as it tries to activate. Online Armor's behaviour \ndetection ensures that even specially created or new keyloggers are detected \nand prevented. \n\nMail Shield\n&quot;Phishing&quot; is the name of a scam which uses fake emails and websites to trick \nusers into disclosing personal information. Online Armor checks inbound mail \nfor tricks used by scammers and, depending on the certainty it will warn you \nor remove the email. The mail filter works with any email client that supports \nPOP3 or IMAP, including Outlook, Outlook Express, Thunderbird, The Bat!, \nIncredimail, Eudora and others. \n\nWeb Shield\nMany websites use tricks to install dangerous software on your computer. \nThe type of software can range from the irritating display of popup advertising, \nthrough to software designed to steal information or defraud you. \n\n\nChanges release 4.0.0.44 - 21st April 2010\n\n2051 Fixed: &quot;Reset list&quot; yielded inconsistent statuses on listed computers\n2045 Fixed: &quot;Reset list&quot; is unreliable Resolved (Fixed)\n2053 OA++ detecting thumbs.db files as suspicious ADS (encryptable) \n2054 Fixed: Oascan can't open ADS associated with a folder\n2063 Fixed: OA vs Registrar Registry Manager - Resolved\n2064 Fixed: OA vs CLT (OLE impersonation)\n2067 Fixed: Button symbol inconsistencies\n2068 Fixed: GUI lock option is available after entering blank password but \n     doesn't lock GUI \n2069 Fixed: GUI autolocks after entering password without selecting autolock option\n2083 Leaktest protection against kernel5b.exe (print monitor) improved.\n2073 Fixed: HIPS doesn't prevent DDE test of CLT to start the IE and blocks \n     DDE communication without pop up \n2074 Fixed: Web Site Shown in Computers Tab \n2075 Fixed: Build 38 ''clear history on reboot'' issue\n2077 Fixed: Hosts rework \n2080 Typo in unknown BITS job alert - Resolved (Fixed)\n2082 Fixed: CreateSection hook doesn't take in account root handle \n2094 Fixed: Blank autostart popup\n2099 Fixed: Wording in hosts file alert\n2100 Fixed: Status column tooltip needs updating in Hosts section \n2101 Fixed: Text needs updating on Options section of Hosts \n2102 Fixed: Blocked programs are unable to be deleted in Hosts\n2066 Fixed: build 37 Blank security centre window\n2078 Fixed: Remaning scan time on OA++ scans is &quot;out of sync&quot;\n2104 Fixed: OASIS rating check is skipped during Safety Check Wizard \n2105 Fixed: Safety Check Wizard checking latest OA ratings skipped during install\n2108 Fixed: Trojan.Win32.Vilsel!IK problem \n2117 Fixed: [Win7 x64] BSOD when system shutdown being done soon after coming back \n     from hibernation \n2111 Fixed: PC can hang on waking up after sleep \n2113 Improve History ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ use Windows regional settings for date format.\n2091 Use Windows regional settings for date format.\nThe domain used by Online Armor changed from tallemu.com to online-armor.com.\n\nThere is LIMITED Windows 7 x64 support. What this means is that the core x64 \nsupport is in place, but some features do not work. We do not consider the x64 \nversion of Online Armor release ready, but as a result of user requests, we're \nmaking it possible to install Online Armor (paid versions only) on Windows 64 \nwith this release.\n\nHowever, to prevent a situation where a user un-knowingly installs Online Armor \non an x64 machine and incorrectly assumes full protection, the installer program \nneeds to be run with of a command line parameter ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ consider this as 'informed \nconsent'.\n\nTherefore, to get Online Armor Premium or Online Armor ++ installed on \na Windows 7 x64 machine, add the command line parameter &quot;/dragonslayer&quot; \nwhen running the installer. \n\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nOnline Armor currently runs on XP/Vista/Windows 7. This program is not suitable \nfor Windows Vista 64. However, check the compatibility section to see if there \nare any conflicts with other software you may be running. \n\nNote: Product does not currently support the following operating systems:\nWindows XP 64, Windows Vista 64, Windows 7 64, Windows 98/Me \n\nRecommended Requirements\n- Windows XP &amp; Windows Vista &amp; Windows 7 (All 32bit)\n- 512 MB RAM\n- 20 MB hard disk space\n- Internet access\n\nCompatibility\n- Online Armor is not available for windows Vista 64bit or Windows 7 64 bit\n\n\n\nMore info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.online-armor.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.online-armor.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;When using TPB please read these important notes: \n****************************************************\n\n01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their \n    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're \n    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not \n    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack \n    or folder from being auto-protected &amp; auto-scanned by the AV software.\n\n03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored \n    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).\n\n04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.sandboxie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.sandboxie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.\n\n06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies \n    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n\n09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n11- In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n13- Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting &quot;TPB's Most Ridiculous Comments&quot;:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my TPB account:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThis torrent is scanned with:\n1- Norton Internet Security \n2- Avira AntiVir Premium \n3- avast!

Reported malware detected \nby other anti-malware software probably are false positives!\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting \nfake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to \nfrustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less \ndownloadspeed etc etc. \n\nIt's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\n                                         \n* Status torrent at May 22, 2010 - 22.30 CET: clean, tested &amp; working.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ab8cdf8697163b76c5bd2545611c8e3fc311328","amp;dn":"Online+Armor+Premium+Firewall+4.0.0.44+%2B+TrialReset+v2.5+%5BRH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ab8cdf8697163b76c5bd2545611c8e3fc311328","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,184,205,248,105,113,99,183,108,91,210,84,86,17,200,227,252,49,19,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
