Martin is game as the moron, and this is the kind of film with funny moments people still talk about. --Tom Keogh\n\nProduct Description\nThat wild and crazy guy, Steve Martin, makes his film-starring debut in the wacky comedy hit The Jerk. Steve portrays Navin Johnson, adopted son of a poor black sharecropper family, whose crazy inventions lead him from rags to riches and right back to rags. Along the way, he's smitten with a lady motorcycle racer, survives a series of screwball attacks by a deranged killer, becomes a millionaire by inventing the &quot;Opti-grab&quot; handle for glasses - and shows why he's one of the hottest comic performers in the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9000ed631eee15055544b7a45346530f4ac45a0c","amp;dn":"The+Jerk+%5B26th+Anniversary+Edition%5D+FULL+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9000ed631eee15055544b7a45346530f4ac45a0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,0,237,99,30,238,21,5,85,68,183,164,83,70,83,15,74,196,90,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
