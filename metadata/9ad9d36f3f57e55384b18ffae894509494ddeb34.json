Their style tended towards the humorous (often irreverent or slapstick humor), with a few exceptions. Their game design philosophy was that the player should never die or reach a complete dead-end, although there have been exceptions to the former (such as Maniac Mansion, both Indiana Jones games and one in The Secret of Monkey Island that can be considered an Easter egg).\n\nCommon features between the games include in-joke references to both other LucasArts games and LucasFilm productions, including the number 1138, quotes such as the phrase &quot;I have a bad feeling about this&quot;, as well as other running gags that spanned numerous games --  Chuck the Plant and Sam &amp; Max cameo appearances among them. Another feature, used in several of the games, was to allow the player to control more than one character, often being able to switch between them at will. For example, in Maniac Mansion the player has control of a group of three kids with complementary skills and weaknesses, while in Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis the player gets to play as both Indiana Jones and his partner, Sophia Hapgood.\n\nA special programming tool called the SCUMM engine was used to design all the games from Maniac Mansion to The Curse of Monkey Island, while the GrimE engine took over from Grim Fandango onwards. For those people who own the original MS-DOS versions of the SCUMM games and have found that these no longer work on modern computers, it is possible, using the original data files, to play the games on modern platforms using the ScummVM interpreter.\n\nThis is a complete list of LucasArts adventure games, from 1986 to 2000:\n\n    * Labyrinth (1986) - Did not use SCUMM and the only one never released to PC\n    * Maniac Mansion (1987)\n    * Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders (1988)\n    * Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure (1989)\n    * Loom (1990)\n    * The Secret of Monkey Island (1990)\n    * Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge (1991)\n    * Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis (1992)\n    * Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle (1993)\n    * Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road (1993)\n    * Full Throttle (1995)\n    * The Dig (1995)\n    * The Curse of Monkey Island (1997)\n    * Grim Fandango (1998) - used GrimE engine not SCUMM\n    * Escape from Monkey Island (2000) - used GrimE engine not SCUMM\n    \nMost adventure games by LucasArts were lauded by critiques and fans alike, often winning awards in the process and developing a cult following. Now they have been complied onto a Mega-Game-Pack-style DVD -- all as ppGames -- so these classics of yesteryear can once again be easily &amp; conveniently enjoyed (and obsessed upon) all over again. And because they are ppGames, you know they'll install great on just about any Windows OS you prefer (XP, Vista, NT/2000, LastXP, LastV, etc.)\n\nThe SCUMM games on this DVD require the ScummVM emulator and as such only the files required by ScummVM are contained herein. ScummVM was chosen to play the SCUMM-based games because, well, that's what it was designed for and that's what it's best at. So consequently it is easier to set up &amp; use, has extremely good support for those games, has some nicer graphical and audio enhancements, and probably most importantly: circumvented copy protections. Additionally, with the included ScummVM Tools, some of the games can be compressed to about half their original size -- this is especially helpful with systems that have limited storage space. Look for the shortcuts to accomplish this in the game's startmenu.\n\nNote: Both Grim Fandango and Escape From Monkey Island (MI4) were created using the GrimE engine. Therefore these games are NOT supported by ScummVM -- note: RESIDUAL, a sub-project of ScummVM, should address many issues in the future but it is still in development and far from complete. And though these two games were released in the &quot;Windows-era&quot; they are NOT quite 100% compatible with the hardware out there so your mileage may vary... (depending on your graphics hardware). All the same, they are readily and easily ppGame capable so they were included in the collection for sake of completion. The other games in this pack that do NOT require the ScummVM emulator include the following: Labyrinth (requires a C64 Emulator... included in this pack), and Maniac Mansion Deluxe (a Windows remake). \n\nExcept for the CD audio files, the game files in this pack are the original uncompressed ones. The CD audio tracks have been transcoded to Ogg tracks using Vorbis Oggenc v2.85 (libvorbis 1.2.0 16-Mar-2008) at VBR quality 6 (nominal bitrate 192kbps) and therefore are very close in quality to the original WAV files.\n\nThis disk also contains, wherever possible, any source-code used for installing, launching, or playing the games. And be sure to check out some of the goodies in the games' startmenus.\n\n'Built on LXP technology' ...

Later, the game finds the crew on an alien planet trying to discover why there seems to be no sentient life, discovering the secrets the planet holds, and trying to find a way back home. The game was the eleventh game to use the SCUMM scripting language. \n\t\nFull Throttle (1995)\n\tThe game follows a biker named Ben, as he uncovers a plot of murder that threatens to damage himself, his gang, and his very way of life. The game is a graphical adventure game, originally developed in-house and released on 30 April 1995 by LucasArts. It is the tenth game to use the SCUMM adventure game engine.\n\nGrim Fandango (1998)\n\tThe game follows Manny Calavara, a grim reaper for the Department of Death in the Land of the Dead. He learns that the system he works for is corrupt, after a woman who led a great life, Mercades (Meche) Colomar, doesn't get to go straight to the seventh level of the afterlife, the land of eternal rest. Manny must take a four year journey to find out who's behind the corruption, find Meche, and earn himself a place in the land of eternal rest. It was the first LucasArts adventure game to not use the SCUMM scripting language. Instead, it used an engine called GrimE (Grim Edit), which was based upon the LUA open source scripting language.\n\t\nIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)\n\tThe game follows the plotline of the Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade motion picture. At the beginning of the game, Indiana Jones must rescue his father from the Nazis by using clues from his father's diary documenting everything that is known about the Holy Grail that once held the blood of Jesus Christ at the Last Supper. Later, Indiana Jones must use the grail diary to find the cup of Christ so that he may use it's miraculous powers to save his father's life. This game features action sequences, in which Indiana Jones can fight his way out of situations instead of using his wits. The game features a Sierra-like score system, where the player is given a score based on which paths are chosen, and whether battles were overcome with wits or by fighting. It was the third game to use the SCUMM scripting language. The FMTowns version is the version included in this pack.\n\t\nIndiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis (1992)\n\tThe game follows Indiana Jones and Sophia Hapgood, who is a playable character in some parts of the game, as they discover the lost city of Atlantis, and stop the Nazis from using the power source of Atlantis for world conquest. Fate of Atlantis featured three different paths to choose for completion of the central part of the game. The player can choose between: The Wits Path (Indy has to use his brains to solve problems), the Fists Path (lighter puzzles, lots of fist fights and action movie-like solutions to problems), and the Team Path (features the Sophia Hapgood character as a reluctant sidekick and part of many puzzles). Each path includes some new objects and locations, different characters and dialogue lines, and alternate ways to progress through the adventure to reach Atlantis. It was the seventh game to use the SCUMM scripting language.\n\t\nLabyrinth (1986)\n\tRevived using a Commodore-64 Emulator, Labyrinth is a graphic adventure computer game inspired by the Jim Henson fantasy film. Developed for the Apple IIe/c, Commodore 64/128, and MSX2, it was the first adventure game by the LucasArts development house, and as such it can be seen as a more primitive precursor to the development of the SCUMM game engine. The game is a menu-driven adventure game, played from a third-person perspective. It opens as a text-based adventure during which the player goes to the theater to see the film Labyrinth. After the movie starts and an image of Jareth comes onto the movie screen, the game becomes a graphic adventure.\n\nLoom (1990)\n\tThe game follows Bobbin Threadbare as he learns how to use his magical powers through his distaff and as he eventually saves the world from the Lord of Chaos, who was unraveling the Loom (the source of power for the members of the weaver's guild). It was the fourth game to use the SCUMM scripting language. The project was led by Brian Moriarty, a former Infocom employee and author of the classic text adventures Wishbringer (1985), Trinity (1986) and Beyond Zork (1987).\n\nManiac Mansion (1987)\n\tManiac Mansion is the game for which the SCUMM (&quot;Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion&quot;) engine was created and named after, which went on to be used by LucasArts for ten more years to create 12 original titles. The game follows Dave Miller and a group of his friends as they break into a strange mansion in an attempt to rescue Dave's girlfriend Sandy and stop the evil purple meteor from taking over the world. The game has a group of six characters to choose from (Dave must always be in your party), and multiple possible endings. Maniac Mansion has become known among video game players and programmers for its highly-acclaimed gameplay and its introduction of new ideas into gaming, including multiple possible endings, multiple user-selectable characters with significantly different abilities, and critical clues contained in numerous cut scenes.\n\t\nManiac Mansion Deluxe (2004)\n\tIn 2004, fans released a remake called Maniac Mansion Deluxe, which runs under Windows, features heavily enhanced graphics, music throughout the whole game (borrowed from Day of the Tentacle), and fixes some bugs and inconsistencies found in the original release of the game. Furthermore, some changes were implemented, such as a slightly harder puzzle to remove the paint blotch on the fourth floor.\n\t\nManiac Mansion 2: Day of the Tentacle (1993)\n\tThis sequel to Maniac Mansion first follows the nerd from the first game, Bernard Bernoulli, and his roommates Hoagie and Laverne as they rescue green tentacle from Dr. Fred's basement. Later, the game follows the trio as they go back in time to stop the evil purple tentacle from changing the past for his own benefit. It was the eighth game to use the SCUMM scripting language.\n\nThe Secret of Monkey Island (1990)\n\tThe Secret of Monkey Island is a well-known adventure game that was developed by LucasArts (then Lucasfilm Games). The game spawned a number of sequels, collectively known as the Monkey Island series. Released in 1990, The Secret of Monkey Island is the fifth game to use the SCUMM engine. It made a name for LucasArts as an adventure game development studio. The game, memorable for its witty humor, was primarily designed by Ron Gilbert, with Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman. The trio would also helm the development of the game's sequel Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge.  At first, the game follows Guybrush's attempts to prove himself a pirate; later, he attempts to rescue his new-found love, Elaine Marley, from the clutches of the ghost pirate LeChuck.\n\t\nMonkey Island 2 - LeChuck's Revenge (1991)\n\tThe game's story centers on the wannabe pirate Guybrush Threepwood. After defeating ghost pirate LeChuck in The Secret of Monkey Island, little is known of what happened between Guybrush Threepwood and Elaine Marley. The sequel involves Guybrush's attempts to both find the mysterious treasure, Big Whoop, win back Elaine's love, and must again defeat Captain LeChuck, who has returned as a zombie awoken by a voodoo spell. It was the second game in the Monkey Island series, the sixth game to use the SCUMM scripting language, and the first game to use the iMUSE sound system. The development team for the game was largely the same as for the first game in the series. The project was lead by Ron Gilbert, and he was once more joined by Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman. LeChuck's Revenge is considered by critics to be among the best of LucasArts' adventure games.\n\nThe Curse of Monkey Island (1997)\n\tThe game's story centers around Guybrush Threepwood, a wannabe pirate who must lift a curse from his love Elaine Marley. As the story progresses, he must deal with a band of mysterious pirates and a French buccaneer, as well as his old archnemesis LeChuck. It was the third game in the Monkey Island series and is the twelfth and last LucasArts game to use the SCUMM engine, which was extensively upgraded for its last outing before being replaced by the GrimE engine for the next game in the series, Escape from Monkey Island. The Curse of Monkey Island is the first Monkey Island game to include voice acting, and has a more cartoon-ish graphic style than the earlier games.\n\nEscape from Monkey Island (2000)\n\tThe game follows Guybrush Threepwood and Elaine Marley as they return to Melee Island from their honeymoon. There they discover that Elaine Marley's position of governor has been revoked, her mansion is scheduled to be demolished, and a politician named Charles L. Charles is running for the governorship. Guybrush learns that the islands are being purchased one by one, and pirates are being forced out in favor of tacky Carribean-themed tourism. Guybrush must find out who is threatening his way of life, piracy, and also find a way to save Elaine's mansion. It was the fourth game in the Monkey Island series, and the second game to use the GrimE LUA-based scripting language.\n\nSam and Max Hit the Road (1993)\n\tThe game first follows the crime fighting duo, a dog named Sam and a lagomorph named Max, as they recover a bigfoot who was stolen from a carnival. Later, the game follows the characters as they uncover an ancient spell to restore the Earth to it's original state. It was the ninth game to use the SCUMM scripting language.\n\nZak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders (1988)\n\tThe game first follows Zak McKracken, a tabloid reporter who slowly discovers a plot by an alien race to take over the Earth. Later, the game adds three additional playable characters (a scientist named Annie Larris, and two Yale students named Melissa China and Leslie Bennett), and places the characters on a quest to find the missing pieces of an alien device that will save all of humankind. It was the second game to use the SCUMM scripting language. The project was led by David Fox and was co-designed and co-programmed by Matthew Alan Kane. The FMTowns version is the version included in this pack.\n\n\n******** SCREENSHOTS ********\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://picasaweb.google.com/TheFreezerBox/LucasArts_Adventures_MGP#slideshow&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://picasaweb.google.com/TheFreezerBox/LucasArts_Adventures_MGP#slideshow&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n******** DOWNLOADS ********\n\n(NOTE: Don't Download this to a FAT32 partition, it wont handle files &gt;4 gig)\n\nISO Size: 4.17 GB\nInstalled Size: 5.39 GB (3.94 after ScummVM Tools)\n\nFile: MGP_LucasArts_Adventures_Reloaded.iso\nCRC-32: a8889544\n   MD4: c4157ed7ebbf564eef0e87e789234e43\n   MD5: 259add8c0f0b1da9df5debd16c9d9507\n SHA-1: 2ac63533e7f31d63e55cf4476a98015a835338b0\n  ED2K: 981A051447294C1ACE79DC7948D9B7B4\n\nTorrent Info Hash: 9AD9D36F 3F57E553 84B18FFA E8945094 94DDEB34\n\n******** NEWS/UPDATES ********\n\nThis is a heavily updated version of the previous torrent which is no longer being seeded\n\nAlso, ScummVM v1.0.0 is now available!
