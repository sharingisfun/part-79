You can train your character up to the best of his/her ability and then fight the best in the world for the championship belt.\n\nRound 2 adds some new play modes and characters into the mix of previous fighters. In this round, there are now 3 levels to the RUMBLE combo gauge (much like a Street Fighter game). Once you reach the third level, you can hit your enemy for six, out of the ring and into the crowd.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e46a4810e4f992878dd1f843658a494443a7081","amp;dn":"Ready+2+Rumble%3A+Round+2+%28Dreamcast%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e46a4810e4f992878dd1f843658a494443a7081","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,70,164,129,14,79,153,40,120,221,31,132,54,88,164,148,68,58,112,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
