one-off \n        drama inspired by the true story of Dr Anne Turner by award-\n        winning writer Frank McGuinness. Having just witnessed the \n        death of her husband Jack from an incurable neurological \n        disease, Anne Turner (Julie Walters) is diagnosed with a \n        near-identical illness. With determined rationality, Anne's \n        answer is that once her illness has reached a critical point, \n        she will take her own life. And she needs her children's \n        support. But the more her son and two daughters struggle to \n        gain consensus over their mother's desire to die, as they \n        struggle to find another way through, the further they pull \n        apart. From Jessica's silent recriminations to Sophie's \n        stubborn practicality, the magnitude of the situation \n        threatens to tear the family to pieces. Anne must also face \n        the fury of her best friend Claire whose opposing views bring \n        them into direct and vocal conflict. Kate Harwood, Controller, \n        Series and Serials, BBC Drama Production, says: &quot;One of \n        Ireland's foremost dramatists, Frank brings a lightness of \n        touch, dark wit and a heart-wrenching humanity to this piece \n        inspired by Anne Turner's story about life and death, love \n        and family.&quot; \n \n \n     \n                                           \n                   RIP NOTES                     \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n \n \n                                    Enjoy!\n \n \n \n     \n                                           \n               GROUP INFORMATION                 \n        9 Years of the Force and still         \n                     going strong                      \n     \n \n           What we are looking for:\n\n           * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n           * Fios x264 rippers or cappers\n           * also we have a contest to annouce we are in need of a\n           * new nfo ascii artwork design email us with your designs\n           * winners artwork will be added as our new nfo\n           * dont forget to tag your work\n           * If you think you can help contact us on irc\n           * or email us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;10567f62737550786563783e7179&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2049ace1bd355a954ed5a5815dc869df1ad25fe0","amp;dn":"A.Short.Stay.In.Switzerland.2009.DVDRip.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2049ace1bd355a954ed5a5815dc869df1ad25fe0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,73,172,225,189,53,90,149,78,213,165,129,93,200,105,223,26,210,95,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
