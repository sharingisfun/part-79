It was originally recorded by Jennifer Warnes on her 1987 album Famous Blue Raincoat, which consisted entirely of songs written or co-written by Cohen.\n\nLeonard Cohen's own quasi-synthpop version of the song (with additional verses) was released in 1988 as the first track on his album I'm Your Man. Cohen's then girlfriend, Dominique Isserman, shot a black and white promotional video for Cohen's version of &quot;First We Take Manhattan&quot;.\n\nOn his 1988 tour, instead of the original, Euro-disco-influenced arrangement of both his and Warnes' studio versions, Cohen introduced the new, funk-influenced arrangement, suggested by his backing singers Perla Batalla and Julie Christensen. He continued to perform song this way in 1993, 2008 and 2009 tours.\n\nCohen's studio recording plays over the closing credits of the 2009 film Watchmen.\n\nI'm Your Man is a 1988 album by Leonard Cohen.\n\nIt was widely considered Cohen's &quot;comeback&quot; album, after the poorly promoted Various Positions in 1984. The album also marked Cohen's further move into modern musical textures, with many songs having a synthpop production.\n\nThe song &quot;Everybody Knows&quot; was one of Cohen's first writing collaborations with Sharon Robinson, who would become a frequent collaborator in the future. Most notably, Robinson co-wrote every song on Cohen's 2001 outing Ten New Songs.\n\nIn &quot;Tower of Song&quot;, Cohen discusses songwriting and acknowledges the influence of Hank Williams (&quot;a hundred floors above me&quot;).\n\n&quot;I'm Your Man&quot; was number 1 in Norway for 16 weeks. The album is silver in the UK and gold in Canada.\n\nIt was ranked 51 on Pitchfork Media's list of the 100 best albums of the 1980s.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fcd26d803fa8ff87cdf3ebc6dba5cc3b187ef35","amp;dn":"Leonard+Cohen+-+First+We+Take+Manhattan++%28Xvid-2nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fcd26d803fa8ff87cdf3ebc6dba5cc3b187ef35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,205,38,216,3,250,143,248,124,223,62,188,109,186,92,195,177,135,239,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
