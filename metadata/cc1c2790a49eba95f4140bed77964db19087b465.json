These files have been processed with BIAS SoundSoap (v2.1) to remove the crackles and pops inherent in vinyl playback.\n\n\n==WHY ONLY ONE SONG?==\n\nThis is simply meant as a demo of the benefit of SoundSoap in processing vinyl recordings.  My hope is that HMVinyl will be sufficiently impressed by the difference that he will make it a part of his workflow. ;-)\n\nHowever, I also hope others who are interested in hi-fi rips of vinyl recordings will download and offer comment.\n\nBTW, the audio is still not pristine. Some crackling is occasionally audible, but in quieter segments of the song (when the vinyl artifacts are most obvious) I think the quality is much improved.\n\nIf you enjoy this file, please comment.\n\n==WHY TWO FILES?==\n\nMostly because playback of FLAC files using VLC on my Mac sounds like absolute shit. But also, in my experience, unless you have a special soundcard or an external DAC and a lot of expensive hi-fi equipment, the cleanest digital audio source available to most people is an iPod with a good set of headphones. FLAC doesn't play on iPods, but ALAC does.  \n\n\n==WHERE DO I GET THE WHOLE ALBUM?==\n\nHMVinyl's torrent is here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5580406/Pink_Floyd_-_The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon_[Kenwood_Marble_TT]_HMV&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5580406/Pink_Floyd_-_The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon_[Kenwood_Marble_TT]_HMV&lt;/a&gt;\n\n==HOW DO I USE SOUNDSOAP?==\nWatch these tutorials:\n\n\nRip details from MVinyl's torrent:\nFiles recorded on 05/22/10 using: \nKenwood KD-2055 Marble-Base Belt Drive Turntable\nStanton 500 Cartridge\nKenwood KR-3090 Reciever/Phono Preamp\nSony Sound Forge 10.0\n2 Channel (Stereo)\n96 KHz\n24 bit\n4,608 kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc1c2790a49eba95f4140bed77964db19087b465","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+-+The+Great+Gig+in+the+Sky+%5Bvinyl%5D+cleaned+with+Sound","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc1c2790a49eba95f4140bed77964db19087b465","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,28,39,144,164,158,186,149,244,20,11,237,119,150,77,177,144,135,180,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
