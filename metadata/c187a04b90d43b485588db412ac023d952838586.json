They're joined by expert David Rainer.\n\nIn the purple overalls are &quot;Brothers In Arms&quot; consisting of (now) Colonel Dick Strawbridge and his 2 brothers Major David Strawbridge &amp; Captain Bobby Strawbridge. They're joined by expert Dr. Derek Alsop.\n\nThe challenge : build a cannon and fire 3 shots at a target on a military firing range. The team who scores the most hits goes through to the finals.\n\n(The video doesn't run 'true' for unknown reasons, apologies).\n\nHelp me seed (to a ratio of at least 1.5) &amp; get these 'out there' - I have a max. upload speed of c. 80k/s. \n\nThe more help I get the quicker everyone gets them. \n\nIt's a team effort. So please, do your part.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c187a04b90d43b485588db412ac023d952838586","amp;dn":"Scrapheap+Challenge+-+02x02+-+Cannon.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c187a04b90d43b485588db412ac023d952838586","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,135,160,75,144,212,59,72,85,136,219,65,42,192,35,217,82,131,133,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
