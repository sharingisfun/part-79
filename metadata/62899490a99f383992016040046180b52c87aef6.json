Goal was &quot;preview&quot; quality, not the ultimate one - what is self-evident from redicolously small file-size. Trade-offs must be included.\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).\nFor example; when I finish encoding, I always check out the file, do short preview, rewinding back and forth. It usualy looks ugly - but - then I move back and sit on the sofa, 6 feet away - and everything looks as it should. Nice and watchable, like on older, analog TV set.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62899490a99f383992016040046180b52c87aef6","amp;dn":"David.Letterman.2010.04.19.J.Lo.H264%5Bquark%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62899490a99f383992016040046180b52c87aef6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,137,148,144,169,159,56,57,146,1,96,64,4,97,128,181,44,135,174,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
