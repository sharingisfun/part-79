Check out &quot;Night Scene&quot; by the Rumblers and you'll see the beginnings of surf noir. &quot;Intoxica&quot; and &quot;Church Key&quot; by the Revels are also classics that predate frat rock. All giid stuff.\n\n\nTracklist:\n01. Cecilia Ann - The Surftones - 1964\n02. Inertia! - The Hustlers - 1964\n03. Surf Rat - The Rumblers - 1963\n04. Bangalore - The Blazers - 1963\n05.
