Maurice John Vaughn's piercing contemporary blues are every bit as powerful as the leading brand.\nOne of Chicago's leading young blues talents, Maurice is also one of its most versatile. He's a slashing lead guitarist, a searing tenor saxophonist, and an uncommonly imaginative songwriter with a streetwise vocal delivery perfectly tailored to his distinctive material. In addition, Maurice has worked extensively as a record producer, and he runs his own record label. The 36-year-old native of Chicago's South Side got his start in music playing the saxophone in high school, joining a youthful combo dubbed the Gents of Soul. &quot;They needed a sax player, and I wanted to be in the band,&quot; Maurice says. He took his tenor into the recording studio for the first time in 1976 with an R&amp;B group called The Chosen Few, for Chi-Sound Records. Maurice began doubling on guitar in the mid-'70s. &quot;The jobs started drying up on saxophone, and everybody was saying, 'Well, we just need a rhythm section,&quot;' says Maurice. &quot;So I had to get into the rhythm section to keep working.&quot; Maurice didn't get involved in the blues scene until 1979, when guitarist Phil Guy sat in with Vaughn's soul band. Guy then hired the group to back him on a Canadian tour, and Maurice became an instant convert to the blues, appearing on a pair of Guy LPs for the British JSP label. After a year and a half with Phil, Maurice began to free-lance extensively, playing with some of Chicago's leading blues artists, including Luther Allison, Queen Sylvia Embry, Valerie Wellington and Son Seals. Maurice first toured Europe with Seals in 1983. He hooked up with saxman A.C. Reed the following year and they've remained together ever since. Maurice handled much of the lead guitar on Reed's recent Alligator album, I'm In The Wrong Business. A.C. and Maurice also cut an LP together in 1985 for the French Blue Phoenix label, entitled I Got Money. [FROM THE ALBUM NOTES]\n\n01. I Done Told Ya 4:55\n02. Garbage Man Blues 5:20\n03.
