I've been taping shows for more than 20 years and have an\nawful lot of masters. Most of them are in the old cassette format, some others are on MiniDisc and others are on CD. I've\ntaped many shows of many artists over the years, so don't be surprised if you will find many different artists taped! Some\nshows are already circulating, some others have not circulated through collectors yet. But most of all, enjoy!\nThey all come from my mastertapes!\n\nDAVID BOWIE\nRoma, Curva Sud dello Stadio Olimpico\n9 July 1996\nRAI StereoDue broadcast\n\nLook back in anger\nScary monsters\nThe Heart's filthy lesson\nOutside\nAladdin sane\nVoyeur of utter destruction (as beauty)\nThe man who sold the world\nHallo spaceboy\nBreaking glass\nTelling lies\nJump they say\nUnder pressure\nHeroes\nDJ Outro (&quot;we cannot hide you that David Bowie will come back, even for two encores...&quot;)\n\nDavid Bowie - vocals, guitar\nReeves Gabrels - guitar\nGail Ann Dorsey - bass, vocals\nMike Garson - keyboards\nZachary Alford - drums\n\nNot to be confused with the silver called 'Trouble in Rome', this is indeed my master tape.\nThis concert is well known for being one of the shortest Bowie full performance. At one point, after exactly one hour of live set,\nBowie left the stage. Everybody thought that he would return for the encores, but it was not the case: Bowie had already left\nto come back to his hotel!\n\nBowie's management never wanted to give any explanation about this, since the singer was contracted to play 100 minutes. But\na few speculations can be done: first of all, the audience was far below Bowie's normal standards: 4,000 people attending a\nshow in a stadium that can hold more than 60,000! Second, the fight with the photographs, who were allowed to take shots\nduring the first song only (instaed of two, as usually happens). As a protest, the photographs threw their photo passes on\nthe stage while leaving at the end of the opening track.\n\nThe recording is quite good. As always, italian radio stroke again, putting an idiot DJ to comment all the tracks. I have\nremoved all the comments by crossfading all tracks. I only left the final comments at the end of Heroes, where he's saying\nthat he's pretty sure Bowie would come back for the encores, even giving the names of the songs he would perform later.
