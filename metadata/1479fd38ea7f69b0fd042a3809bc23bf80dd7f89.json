Here, Dave and Cody take on two roles to show how to survive this desolate location: Dave stays with the vehicle and signals for rescue while Cody heads out in search of water. But first, Dave and Cody strip the car for everything it's worth, salvaging the battery, headlights, electrical wiring, tires and seat cushions. They fight volcanic rock, heat exhaustion, altitude sickness,dehydration, rodents and a debilitating illness that literally brings Cody to his knees.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1479fd38ea7f69b0fd042a3809bc23bf80dd7f89","amp;dn":"Dual+Survival+S01E04+-+TyTy555","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1479fd38ea7f69b0fd042a3809bc23bf80dd7f89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,121,253,56,234,127,105,176,253,4,42,56,9,188,35,191,128,221,127,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
