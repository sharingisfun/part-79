Join the US Marine Corps as they take on the might of the chinese PLA and fight to stop a flashpoint engagement over oil erupting into full blown war. Play solo, PvP or with up to 3 friends CO-Operatively as you choose your path through this visceral &amp; brutal conflict, using the full force of authentically detailed US Marine Corps weapons, vehicles, aircraft, munitions and tactics.\n\nThe game takes place on a small, fictional island based on the island of Kiska\nlocated off the north coast of Japan called Skira and is set in the near future.\nThe island is a contested territory between Russia and China and becomes the\ncentre of an armed conflict when a large untapped oil and gas reserve is\ndiscovered there. The Russians who own the island ask America (their allies)\nto intervene as they are busy dealing with a large Chinese force on their own\nRussian border. The game begins as the player arrives as part of the United\nStates Marine Corps which is tasked with capturing the island, on behalf of the\nRussians, from the Chinese military.\n\n\nOperation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising (often referred to as Operation Flashpoint 2) is a first person tactical military game for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 developed by British game developer Codemasters. Codemasters have advertised the game as a tactical shooter designed to realistically represent modern infantry combat. It's a follow-up to Bohemia Interactive's Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, but was developed entirely by Codemasters due to a falling out between the two companies.\n\n\n\n\n-=====  Minimum requirement =====-\n\n\nOperating system: Windows XP SP2 or later\nGPU: DirectX 9.0c GPU: Shader 3.0 (GeForce 7900 GT / 256 MB VRAM or higher)\nSound Card: DirectX Compatible\nRAM Memory: 1 GB (Vista/7), 512 MB (XP)\n8 GB Hard disk: 8 GB\nCPU: Dual Core CPU 2 x 2.4 GHz\nDVD-ROM DVD drive: Dual Layer DVD-ROM\n\n\n-=====  Recommended System =====-\n\n\nOperating system: Windows XP SP2 or later\nGPU: Shader 3.0 (GeForce 8800 GT / 512 MB VRAM or higher), DirectX 9.0c\nSound Card: DirectX Compatible\nRAM Memory: 2 GB\nHard disk: 8 GB\nCPU: Quad Core CPU\nDVD drive: Dual Layer DVD-ROM\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:302f1505217ba761aa1266daff931dad840494ad","amp;dn":"Operation+Flashpoint+2+%3A+Dragon+Rising+PC+MULTI+5+DVD+inc.+crack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"302f1505217ba761aa1266daff931dad840494ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,47,21,5,33,123,167,97,170,18,102,218,255,147,29,173,132,4,148,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
