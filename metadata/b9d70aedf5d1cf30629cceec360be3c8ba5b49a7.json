Should we look on this time as still clearly medieval or as one in which humanity took its first decisive steps into modernity? Was it a period as distant from us as it appears, or was it closer than we suspect? Students of history are still trying, even after so many centuries, to reach anything approaching a consensus on the answers to these questions.\n\nPonder the many contradictions on your own and you may be frustrated by inconclusive answers. Instead, let Professor Philip Daileader be your guide and set you on the path to answers with The Late Middle Ages, the final course in his excellent trilogy that began with The Early Middle Ages and The High Middle Ages.\n\nThis provocative 24-lecture course introduces you to the age's major events, personalities, and developments and arms you with the essentials you need to form your own ideas about this age of extremesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½an age that, according to Professor Daileader, &quot;experiences disasters and tragedies of such magnitude that those who survive them cannot remember the like, and doubt that subsequent generations will be capable of believing their descriptions.&quot;\n\nAn Era of Disease, War, and Religious Turmoil\n\nThere was the Black Death, which killed perhaps half the population of Europe in four years and remained a constant and terrifying presence for centuries to come.\n\nThere was the carnage of frequent wars, particularly the Hundred Years War, and a steady progression in the deadly effectiveness of the weapons with which those wars might be waged. ...\n\nThere was religious turmoil, with the papacy humiliated, the popes departing Rome, and a Great Papal Schism that ultimately produced three competing popes, leaving the Catholic Church with no clear leader for a period of nearly 40 years.\n\nAnd there was the threat of rebellion in both city and country as disasters and social change took their inevitable toll.\n\nAudio\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nEncoder : Fraunhofer (FhG)\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 64 Kbps\nChannel(s) : Mono\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 32 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9d70aedf5d1cf30629cceec360be3c8ba5b49a7","amp;dn":"TTC+-+The+Late+Middle+Ages","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9d70aedf5d1cf30629cceec360be3c8ba5b49a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,215,10,237,245,209,207,48,98,156,206,236,54,11,227,200,186,91,73,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
