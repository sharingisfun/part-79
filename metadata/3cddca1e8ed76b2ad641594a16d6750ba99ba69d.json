Dubbed the ''New Atheism'' advocates are calling for the abandonment of Europe's religious heritage and the adoption of an aggressive secularism. Religion is detrimental to society, they argue. Indeed, in the words of Christopher Hitchens. It ''poisons everything''.&quot;\n\n\n\nbtw if you would permit me to violate some impartiality ethical code, id just like to point out that even if atheism is logically connected with the destruction of any basis of values or absolute morality, it does not in the sightest way impact on whether or not belief in a god is valid or justified.\n\njust really annoys me that people keep making that connection.\n\nanyway that's my 2 cents enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cddca1e8ed76b2ad641594a16d6750ba99ba69d","amp;dn":"Hitchens+vs+Lennox+Can+atheism+save+europe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cddca1e8ed76b2ad641594a16d6750ba99ba69d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,221,202,30,142,215,107,42,214,65,89,74,22,214,117,11,169,155,166,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
