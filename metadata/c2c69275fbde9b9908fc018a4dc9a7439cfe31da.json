Hagen, who has a dead wife believes that he can revive her from the dead. Travis, a man who lost his brother and wants to join him in the after life. Morbius, a bartender who is betrayed by those he loves comes back from the dead to take revenge. And a strange man only known as Mr. Skinny protects the secrets of the Ouija Board and how the stories weave and affect each other. Sick, twisted and real WTF kind of movie.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2c69275fbde9b9908fc018a4dc9a7439cfe31da","amp;dn":"Necromentia+2009+DVDrip+-+cOOt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2c69275fbde9b9908fc018a4dc9a7439cfe31da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,198,146,117,251,222,155,153,8,252,1,138,77,201,167,67,156,254,49,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
