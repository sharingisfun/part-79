Please give back as much as you take.\n\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½4 April 2008\n17-year-old student Carolyn Parsons is murdered and her two classmates Izzy Shapiro and Linda Matthews are charged of soliciting disturbed misfit James Moffitt to murder her as she appeared on their on-line &quot;List of People We'd Like to see Dead&quot;. He later committed suicide. Then Linda cuts a deal with the prosecution and Izzy goes on trial. When Izzy goes on the run it looks like a slam dunk case for Attorney General Williams until Izzy surfaces with a piece of evidence that turns the case on its head. Elsewhere, with Matt gone, Liz resumes her relationship with Frank.\n\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0956036/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35708817b9103b87108ce4a76ac5f45de776842c","amp;dn":"Canterburys+Law+S01E04+-+Sweet+Sixteen.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35708817b9103b87108ce4a76ac5f45de776842c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,112,136,23,185,16,59,135,16,140,228,167,106,197,244,93,231,118,132,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
