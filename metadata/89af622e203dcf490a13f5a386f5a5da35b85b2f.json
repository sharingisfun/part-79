Whether they want to suck, bite, sting or feed on his body, he'll do whatever it takes to better understand what they're all about.\n\nDr. Mike used to be a motorcycle mechanic, but after 10 years of grease and gears he decided to go back to school. But not just any school -- Dr. Mike completed a Ph.D. in Virology from Oxford University. Dr. Mike is really interested in two things: traveling and bugs (the ones that creep around or the ones inside the human body).\n\nJoin Dr. Mike on an unforgettable journey around the world to learn more about creatures who love nothing more than to take a bite out of your vacation.\n\nEpisode:4 &quot;Australian Outback&quot;\nWith average temperatures of around 100 degrees, the Outback is home to some of the planet's smallest but most lethal inhabitants. Dr. Mike explores an eight-legged murderess and a parasite that can turn man's best friend into a killer.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 464 MiB for 46mn 59s 256ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nLanguage          : English\nSubtitles         : None\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 239 Kbps\nAspect            : 624 x 384 (1.625) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 129 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89af622e203dcf490a13f5a386f5a5da35b85b2f","amp;dn":"Bite+Me+With+Dr.+Mike.S01E04.Australian+Outback.WS-PDTV.XviD.Eko","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89af622e203dcf490a13f5a386f5a5da35b85b2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,175,98,46,32,61,207,73,10,19,245,163,134,245,165,218,53,184,91,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
