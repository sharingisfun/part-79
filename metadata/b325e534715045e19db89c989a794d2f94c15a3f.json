How do we manage to block out intense pain? How does our sense of balance keep working under the most extreme conditions? Live action combined with special effects creates incredible imagery to convey the 'feeling' of how our senses work. As an alarm bell goes off, we 'see' the noise, slowed down thousands of times. Ripples of sound roll towards us; we spin around and follow a sound wave as it travels into the dark outer ear canal.\n\nProgramme 3 - Touch and Vision\nHumans are very sensitive to touch, but different parts of our body have different sensitivities. Nigel demonstrates that when it comes to our sense of touch, humans are similar to elephants.Nigel Marven sets out to discover why we are excellent at seeing some things, but sometimes miss what's right in front of our eyes.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 50mn 58s 704ms\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 133 Kbps\nAspect            : 528 x 384 (1.375) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 129 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b325e534715045e19db89c989a794d2f94c15a3f","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Human+Senses+3+of+3+%282004%29+%5BPDTV%5D%7EEkolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b325e534715045e19db89c989a794d2f94c15a3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,37,229,52,113,80,69,225,157,184,156,152,154,121,77,47,148,193,90,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
