J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci. The series follows an FBI Fringe Division team based in Boston, Massachusetts under the supervision of Homeland Security. The team uses unorthodox &quot;fringe&quot; science and FBI investigative techniques to investigate &quot;the Pattern&quot;, a series of unexplained, often ghastly occurrences which are occurring all over the world. The show has been described as a cross between The X-Files, Altered States, The Twilight Zone, and Dark Angel. The series premiered in the United States on September 9, 2008, on the Fox network. Fringe is part of a new Fox initiative known as &quot;Remote-Free TV&quot;. Episodes of Fringe are longer than standard dramas on current network television. The show airs with half the commercials, adding about six minutes to the show's run time. On October 1, 2008, Fringe first season was extended to 22 episodes. This was then cut back to 20 episodes with the season finale airing May 12. The series has been renewed for a second season. Season 2 will premiere Thursday, September 17, 2009 at 9:00 PM.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86a4a68122dfcc6378a85959bee4cf2a35fe08ab","amp;dn":"Fringe+S02E23+720p+HDTV+X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86a4a68122dfcc6378a85959bee4cf2a35fe08ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,164,166,129,34,223,204,99,120,168,89,89,190,228,207,42,53,254,8,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
