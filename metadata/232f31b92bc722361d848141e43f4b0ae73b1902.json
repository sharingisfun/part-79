Originally issued as a vinyl double album, it was assured of a UK chart entry at number one due to reported advance sales of over one million.\n\nWhilst commercially successful, the album also drew criticism for containing new versions of the group's (already much-remixed) hit singles from the same year (&quot;Relax&quot; and &quot;Two Tribes&quot;, plus B-side &quot;War&quot;), as well as a surfeit of cover versions in lieu of much new original material.\n\nHowever, the album's evergreen ballad &quot;The Power of Love&quot; would subsequently provide the group with their third consecutive UK number one single.\n\n    * Holly Johnson: lead vocals\n    * Brian Nash: guitar\n    * Peter Gill: drums\n    * Mark O'Toole: bass\n    * Paul Rutherford: vocals\n    * J.
