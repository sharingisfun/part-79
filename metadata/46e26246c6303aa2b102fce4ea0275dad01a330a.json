His assignment was to do the &quot;looping&quot; - dubbed over dialogue for clean movie edits ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ so, for instance, instead of Nicholas Cage saying, &quot;That's bullshit!&quot; you hear Craig's impression of Nick saying, &quot;That's hockeypuck!&quot; Craig said it was a great gig, but the only condition was that he can't reveal which celebrities' voices he overdubs.\nCraig told a story about doing the Richard Belzer roast and meeting Christopher Walken on the dais. Belzer forced him to do his Walken impression for Walken, but Walken was unimpressed: &quot;Wow.&quot; Belzer than forced him to do his Tom Arnold and Adam Sandler impressions: &quot;Walken cuts me off and goes, 'Wait a second. I get it. You're talented,' and goes back to eating his food.&quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46e26246c6303aa2b102fce4ea0275dad01a330a","amp;dn":"Howard+TV+-+Craig+Gass+07-21-09%28wush%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46e26246c6303aa2b102fce4ea0275dad01a330a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,226,98,70,198,48,58,162,177,2,252,228,234,2,117,218,208,26,51,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
