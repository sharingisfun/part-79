Their TC : Bob Thompson. \n\nThe challenge : \n\nBuild balancing rigs to carry vats brimming with liquid around an uneven course, spilling as little as they can. \n\nHelp me seed (to a ratio of at least 2.0) - I have a max. upload speed of c. 80k/s. \n\nIt's a team effort. Please do your part. \n\nUntil I see enough seeding of previous episodes, I won't be allowing anyone to get more than 98% of these episodes. No apologies.
