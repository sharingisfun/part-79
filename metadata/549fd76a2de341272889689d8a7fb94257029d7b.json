It follows the tortured journey of the devastatingly seductive Transylvanian Prince (Gary Oldman) as he moves from Eastern Europe to 19th century London in search of his long lost love\nElisabeta (Winona Ryder), who is reincarnated as the beautiful Mina. Anthony Hopkins co-stars as the famed Doctor Van Helsing and Keanu Reeves is Jonathan Harker who is forced to fight the dark forces of Dracula for the love of Mina. Visually stunning, passionately seductive and utterly irresistible, this is Dracula as you've never seen him before - a powerful and poignant vampire whose yearning for human love ultimately proves his undoing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:549fd76a2de341272889689d8a7fb94257029d7b","amp;dn":"BRAM+STOKERS+DRACULA-H.264+BY+STIG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"549fd76a2de341272889689d8a7fb94257029d7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,159,215,106,45,227,65,39,40,137,104,157,138,127,185,66,87,2,157,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
