The Human Instinct from NZ recorded a number of his tracks included on their influential first albums. Not much is known of the recording or the people involved, according to myth Jesse played all the guitar parts himself with an unknown drummer an unashamed Jimi Hendrix fan the album is a 60's masterpiece, with its own distinct voice. In 1994 the UK label Kissing spell finally released it on CD, Sadly they altered the track order and were maybe a little enthusiastic in their digital 'cleaning up' It was later released on the specialist vinyl only label Acme out of the UK with restored track order and sound in a small limited edition. However if you are a fan of psych, heavy psych, Jimi, 60's Guitar or just quality music this is a must have.\n\nTRACK LISTING\n01 Wake Me\n02 Hear The Good News\n03 Music Is God\n04 Circles\n05 Keep Cool\n06 Shades Of Midnight Sun\n07 Holes In My Hands\n08 Hair Is Down To My Knees\n09 Living Underground\n10 Love Song","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3291d5bc3a2c6711e5ab92040395126df29fc03","amp;dn":"Jesse+Harper+-+guitar+absolution+in+the+shade+of+the+midnight+su","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3291d5bc3a2c6711e5ab92040395126df29fc03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,41,29,91,195,162,198,113,30,90,185,32,64,57,81,38,223,41,252,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
