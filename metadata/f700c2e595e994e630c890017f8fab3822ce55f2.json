Set and shot in Montreal, the 30-minute show revolves around the lives of three bouncers, both in private and at work. The show is notable for its portrayal of the daily hardships facing each of the principal characters. Gritty cinematography and faced-paced direction are also key elements of the showÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s style. All the showÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s episodes were directed by Daniel Grou (aka Podz).\n\nAired by public broadcaster Radio-Canada, the show achieved critical acclaim in local media1 and among viewers, reaching on average 1.3 million people during its first season2. Minuit, le soir eventually won 17 GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©meaux Awards for its three seasons, the local equivalent of the American Emmys, the Geminis in other Canadian provinces or the British Academy Television Awards.\n\nThe title of the show evokes the bouncersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ work cycle and the fact they work at night. Although title screens and promotional logos do not include the comma between minuit and le, it does appears officially in the showÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s title.\n\nMinuit, le soir is set to finish its run at the end of the 13-episode 2007 season, which started on 11 January 2007.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f700c2e595e994e630c890017f8fab3822ce55f2","amp;dn":"Minuit%2C+le+soir+-+Soundtrack+-+insinuendo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f700c2e595e994e630c890017f8fab3822ce55f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,0,194,229,149,233,148,230,48,200,144,1,127,143,171,56,34,206,85,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
