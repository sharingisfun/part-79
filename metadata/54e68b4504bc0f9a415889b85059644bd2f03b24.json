Lem (Justin Long) is a teenaged alien who has just gotten a job at the local planetarium museum, and his family and friends are excited about it. His best friend Skiff (Seann William Scott), a geeky alien teen who works at the local comic book store, is a huge fan of the &quot;Humaniacs&quot; films.\n\nWhen Lem gets home, he asks his next door neighbor and friend, Eckle (Freddie Benedict) about Neera (Jessica Biel), who is Lem's long-time crush. Lem's family is holding a barbecue with the neighbors. Neera is at the barbecue, but when Lem attempts to ask her out, he keeps being interrupted by Neera's hippie friend, Glar.\n\nMeanwhile, a mysterious spacecraft pulls into orbit around Planet 51, sending out a blinking red signal. Down on the planet, under a hidden army base called &quot;Base 9&quot;, the aliens' version of Area 51, there is a basement filled with artifacts from Earth. One artifact &quot;wakes up&quot; from the signal; it is a wheeled probe with artificial intelligence, named &quot;Rover.&quot; Rover breaks out of the basement and escapes to perform its primary mission: to find the astronaut. Its secondary mission is to collect rocks. The army becomes suspicious of Rover's escape and begins to look into its activity.\n\nMeanwhile, just as the barbecue starts, a spacecraft similar to the lunar module touches down right in Lem's backyard. A NASA Astronaut (Dwayne Johnson), Charles 'Chuck' Baker, emerges. As Chuck plants the U.S. flag, he's startled to step on an alien &quot;rubber ducky&quot; someone left on the ground. Everyone stares, and Chuck attempts to get back into his module - but Eckle is in his way, eager for an autograph. Chuck ends up running about, shocked at the revelation that he's on an inhabited planet. Chuck goes into hiding, while the army arrives on the scene.\nNatives of Planet 51. Names: Neera (far left), Lem (left), Eckle (right) and Skiff\n\nGeneral Grawl (Gary Oldman) is at the head of the investigation, and consults Professor Kipple (John Cleese) on intelligence about the &quot;alien invader.&quot; The army then quarantines the area and has citizens start a local &quot;civil defense&quot; force to protect the citizens from becoming &quot;zombies.&quot;\n\nLem discovers Chuck hiding at the planetarium, and both are surprised to learn they speak the same language. Lem realizes this &quot;alien&quot; is no threat, and decides to help Chuck, though it costs him his job and a near arrest at the hands of the army. It becomes apparent that Chuck can't go anywhere near his module, so Lem hides Chuck in his room for the night.\n\nIn the meantime, Rover locates Chuck. Chuck is very happy to see the robot when they reunite, though he tells Rover the probe was not helpful barely escape with Chuck before the general and his men search Lem's room. The group somehow manages to sneak Chuck into the planetarium, and while there, Chuck admits to Lem that he never had &quot;the right stuff.&quot; He says that Lem was the one who had &quot;the right stuff&quot; all along, making risks and sacrifices just for a stranger. Chuck also shows Lem the star that Earth orbits, and how the universe is so much bigger than Lem had thought.\n\nThe next morning, the army brings in vehicles to take Chuck's module to a secret location. Even the media isn't allowed to tell where the spacecraft is going.\n\nLem and Skiff are at a loss for getting Chuck reunited with his craft, but they get an idea from the comic book store. The next night is the premiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re of a new &quot;Humaniacs&quot; movie, and a costume contest will be held. Lem, Skiff, and Chuck disguise themselves as costumed fans, though Chuck gets pulled into the contest. Chuck then introduces some new music as part of the contest and teaches Lem on the spot how to dance. Things go well until Rover comes on the scene, and the aliens at the contest freak at the sight of him. Chaos ensues, and army soldiers start unmasking costumed fans, since they believe the &quot;alien&quot; is among them. General Grawl and Professor Kipple are there, and when the general points out that the alien is wearing a &quot;uniform,&quot; compared to the other costumed fans, Chuck's United States Flag insignia is a dead giveaway.\n\nChuck is captured and unmasked for all to see. When Lem tries to defend Chuck and keep him from being taken away, General Grawl labels Lem a zombie, and Professor Kipple announces he will dissect both their brains. Chuck is not willing to drag Lem into this, so he pretends to &quot;release&quot; Lem from his control, and the crowd believes it. Both Chuck and Rover are locked into armored vehicles and taken away, and Lem is proclaimed a hero.\n\nAt Base 9, General Grawl attempts to get some answers out of Chuck, warning that if he tries taking over the minds of the soldiers in the room, a chain reaction will set off and everyone will shoot at each other and possibly be electrocuted. An accidental gunshot starts said chain reaction, but Chuck is not affected by it. General Grawl survives the electrocution and mistakes the fight as Chuck resisting his demands through his 'zombies', and allows Professor Kipple to have a go at dissecting Chuck's brain.\n\nLem gets his job back at the planetarium and gets to speak on tv, but he cannot truly accept the honor. He feels terrible about Chuck and decides to do the right thing. He hotwires a car, and while he's in the process, Neera comes to talk to him, admiring what he's doing. Neera, Skiff, and Eckle join Lem as they go off to rescue Chuck. However, not only do they not know where the army took him, but they feel they can't find the astronaut without Rover, who had also been taken by the army. But luck is on their side when the little robot shows up on the edge of town, revealing that he unscrewed all the bolts holding the armored vehicle in which he was imprisoned.\n\nThe teens have Rover act as a bloodhound, sniffing out Chuck's trail, leading them to an abandoned gas station in the middle of the desert. They explore, and Skiff sees a &quot;Coca-Cola&quot; bottle in an old fridge, though when he tries to take it, it's actually a hidden trigger that opens up the entrance to Base 9. Lem has Glar distract the soldiers guarding the base with his protest group while the rest of them sneak into the base.\n\nIn a laboratory, Chuck is strapped to a table while Professor Kipple gets ready to take his brain out. Lem and his friends break in through the ceiling, using Rover to scare away the scientists, technicians and guards. They release Chuck and immediately set off alarms by doing so.\n\nRover helps the group find Chuck's 'lunar' module, which had been placed in a hangar, but General Grawl stops them. He warns that if the &quot;alien&quot; attempts to leave, the entire hangar will blow up, and reveals the place is rigged with bombs. Lem tries reasoning with Grawl, which in fact is a distraction to set off the bombs and use the confusion to help Chuck escape. Most of the soldiers flee the firestorm, and the General is knocked out amidst the falling debris. Lem, Neera, Eckle, Skiff, and Rover all get into the module, but Chuck decides he can't leave the General to die, and rescues him from the fire.\n\nTo escape the growing firestorm, Chuck pilots the ship into orbit around the planet, allowing the alien kids to experience outer space. Kiff, Eckle, and Rover enjoy the weightlessness, General Grawl realizes that Chuck is friendly and hasn't turned him into a zombie, and Lem finally gets to ask Neera out on a date.\n\nChuck pilots the module back to the planet's surface, and although the army is ready to shoot as everyone walks out, the General stops them from shooting and says that Chuck is with him. Finally the aliens of Planet 51 get to see that Chuck is harmless and never intended to hurt anyone. Chuck lets Rover stay and become Skiff's pet, and Chuck says goodbye to everyone on Planet 51.\n\nAfter the credits Professor Kipple survived the explosion faced the two soldiers who previously encountered Chuck and Rover bring him down. Chuck leaves Planet 51 peacefully but the alien dog got on board his ship and became Chuck's pet.\n\nIMAGENES\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/8021/planet51movieposter.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/8021/planet51movieposter.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/7276/44315278.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/7276/44315278.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img816.imageshack.us/img816/9079/23035716.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img816.imageshack.us/img816/9079/23035716.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img816.imageshack.us/img816/3447/59797748.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img816.imageshack.us/img816/3447/59797748.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54e68b4504bc0f9a415889b85059644bd2f03b24","amp;dn":"Planet+51+por+memitoxxx+etorrents.org+%28+audio+espa%C3%83%C2%B1ol+latino+NO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54e68b4504bc0f9a415889b85059644bd2f03b24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,230,139,69,4,188,15,154,65,88,137,184,80,89,100,75,210,240,59,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
