For example, ObamaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s criticism of BP is considered ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œun-AmericanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and you can add the Fair Housing Act to Rand PaulÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dreams of private property exempt from anti-discrimination laws.\n\nHowever, finding Rand Paul sympathizers is no more difficult than tuning into Fox News (video) or talking to a Libertarian. There are limits to PaulÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hatred of government, though. Specifically when it comes to Medicare payments to him personally ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ in his words, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPhysicians should be allowed to make a comfortable living.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nRand PaulÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s spokesperson had to resign last year after it was revealed that he left ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHappy Ni***r DayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ MLK posts up on his MySpace page for an entire year, in addition to some other racist nuggets. See the posts\n\nOn the Spill, Baby, Spill front, 20 times more oil could be gushing into the Gulf than previously estimated by BP. Why lowball it? To save money in court, of course.  Meanwhile, Fishermen are getting sick from BPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s chemicals and the EPA has ordered BP to change its dispersant chemicals to something a little less poisonous. And the Texas lab analyzing contamination samples counts BP among their largest clients.\n\nThe Senate passes landmark Financial Reform ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ certainly not a perfect bill, but it's start. Highlights\n\nAlso, a 14-year old autistic boy is accused of terrorism and another special needs 14-year old is forcibly tattooed by NH bullies in their late teens. ICE will not go after the mom of the second grader who questioned Michelle Obama, but that little girl was right ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the Obama Administration is deporting more immigrants than ever before. And thanks to her chicken barter healthcare plan, it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t look like Sue Lowden will get her chance to take on Harry Reid in November.\n\nThese stories, your call, and much more on todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Randi Rhodes Show.\n\n***** Please remember to seed *****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d904ecf4e4eeacf2e3d81ffe5989c9d85abe545","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+May+21+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d904ecf4e4eeacf2e3d81ffe5989c9d85abe545","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,144,78,207,78,78,234,207,46,61,129,255,229,152,156,157,133,171,229,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
