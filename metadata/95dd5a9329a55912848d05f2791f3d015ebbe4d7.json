Companions and Enemies will follow, but this week it's the Doctor's turn in the limelight. What makes the Bachelor of Time tick? Why does he need reining in occasionally? And who are his own heroes? Expect frenetic clips packages (is there an octopus loose in the edit suite?) and fresh insights from nearly departed David Tennant. We also hear from Freema Agyeman, Georgia Moffett (the Doc's instant daughter) and &quot;next Doctor&quot; David Morrissey. Plus, John Barrowman is hilarious about the hierarchy of who has to run fastest in every chase scene.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95dd5a9329a55912848d05f2791f3d015ebbe4d7","amp;dn":"Doctor.Who.Greatest.Moments1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95dd5a9329a55912848d05f2791f3d015ebbe4d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,221,90,147,41,165,89,18,132,141,5,242,121,31,61,1,94,187,228,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
