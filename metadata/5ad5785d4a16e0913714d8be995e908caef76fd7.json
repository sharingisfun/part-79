The program gained particular controversy before and during filming due to unresolved differences on content and approach between Sweeney's production team and Scientology spokesman Tommy Davis, who did not want detractors or perceived enemies of the church to be interviewed or included in the documentary.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ad5785d4a16e0913714d8be995e908caef76fd7","amp;dn":"BBC+Panorama+-+Scientology+and+Me","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ad5785d4a16e0913714d8be995e908caef76fd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,213,120,93,74,22,224,145,55,20,216,190,153,94,144,140,174,247,111,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
