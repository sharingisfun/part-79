It was adapted as an anime television series in 1995. In 1996, the manga won the Kodansha Manga Award for general manga.\n\nWhat can I say - this is a hilarious series that I've been searching for a long time. I couldn't find it anywhere, so I finally came to the realization that it was my responsibility as a torrent fan to buy the series and upload it to the PB community. I hope you enjoy this as much as I do, I think it's hilarious. Please share and seed!\n\nThis is also my first torrent, so please let me know if I can do anything better/more efficiently. Please, only CONSTRUCTIVE criticism. If you don't like this series, keep it to yourself.\n\nEnough said - ENJOY and SHARE!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ac176c00613704e9c263a82f57b0eb010cbebd1","amp;dn":"Ping+Pong+Club","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ac176c00613704e9c263a82f57b0eb010cbebd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,193,118,192,6,19,112,78,156,38,58,130,245,123,14,176,16,203,235,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
