There is no evidence that the Mayans predicted the world would end in 2012, rather their calendar, which they created about 2,000 years ago, was pointing toward the alignment of the sun with the galactic center or &quot;dark rift,&quot; he detailed. The Mayans were oriented to cyclic traditions, and the ending of their calendar in 2012 signified an emphasis on transformation and renewal rather than doomsday, he continued.\n\nIn 1966, scholar Michael D. Coe first proposed the idea there could be cataclysmic events tied to end of the Mayan calendar in December 2012. But Coe's Armageddon-styled interpretation was seen through the biases of his Judeo/Christian background, Jenkins argued.\n\nOne of the few surviving Mayan books (most were destroyed during the Conquest) was the Dresden Codex, which contained sophisticated and accurate astronomical charts and a calendar of Venus' cycles. The planet, which changes from the Evening Star to the Morning Star over time, was incorporated into Mayan mythology in legends like Quetzalcoatl that invoke sacrifice, death, and rebirth, said Jenkins. He also spoke about the roots of shamanism in ancient Maya-- their High King was a shaman who would take sacred plants, to travel between this world and the supernatural realm, to bring back knowledge.\n\nDreams &amp; After Death Communication\n\nLast hour guest, Dr. Gillian Holloway talked about after-death communications via a dreaming research project, precognitive dreams, and dream interpretation. Regarding interpretation, she looks at the action of the dream, rather than dream symbols, to provide allegorical information about a person's life. Contact with deceased loved ones in dreams can have a very different quality than regular dreams, where the departed person might say 'I know you're dreaming, but this is real,' she noted. Dr. Holloway is collecting additional accounts of dream communications with the dead at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;32535651564057535f4172555f535b5e1c515d5f1c&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nWebsite(s):\nalignment2012.com\nthe2012story.com\nlifetreks.com\n\nBook(s):\nThe 2012 Story\nMaya Cosmogenesis 2012\nGalactic Alignment\nThe Complete Dream Book\nDreaming Insights\n\n\n\nbrought to you by:\n                                                \n .d8888b.                                                      888    \nd88P  Y88b                                                     888    \n888    888                                                     888    \n888    888 888  888  .d88b.  888d888 .d8888b  8888b.  .d8888b  888888 \n888    888 888  888 d8P  Y8b 888P&quot;  d88P&quot;        &quot;88b 88K      888    \n888    888 Y88  88P 88888888 888    888      .d888888 &quot;Y8888b. 888    \nY88b  d88P  Y8bd8P  Y8b.     888    Y88b.    888  888      X88 Y88b.  \n &quot;Y8888P&quot;    Y88P    &quot;Y8888  888     &quot;Y8888P &quot;Y888888  88888P'  &quot;Y888 \n\nTorrents: http://thepiratebay.se/user/0vercast/\nRSS: http://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/2eb7e342dacfa8938e79732ad03e1224","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff98ca159234325bea702a83446ad2cd4ef5ff64","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+AM+-+Oct+14+2009+-+Interpreting+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff98ca159234325bea702a83446ad2cd4ef5ff64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,152,202,21,146,52,50,91,234,112,42,131,68,106,210,205,78,245,255,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
