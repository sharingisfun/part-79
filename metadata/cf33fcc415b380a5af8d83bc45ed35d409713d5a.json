Such \nconfidence carries through all of A Broken Frame, a notably more ambitious \neffort than the pure pop/disco of the band's debut. With arranging genius Alan \nWilder still one album away from fully joining the band, Frame became very much \nGore's record, writing all the songs and exploring various styles never again \ntouched upon in later years. &quot;Satellite&quot; and &quot;Monument&quot; take distinct dub/reggae \nturns, while &quot;Shouldn't Have Done That&quot; delivers its slightly precious message \nabout the dangers of adulthood with a spare arrangement and hollow, weirdly \nsweet vocals. Much of the album follows in a dark vein, forsaking earlier \nsprightliness, aside from tracks like &quot;A Photograph of You&quot; and &quot;The Meaning of \nLove,&quot; for more melancholy reflections about love gone wrong as &quot;Leave in \nSilence&quot; and &quot;My Secret Garden.&quot; More complex arrangements and juxtaposed \nsounds, such as the sparkle of breaking glass in &quot;Leave in Silence,&quot; help give \nthis underrated album even more of an intriguing, unexpected edge. Gore's lyrics \nsometimes veer on the facile, but David Gahan's singing comes more clearly to \nthe fore throughout ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ things aren't all there yet, but they were definitely \nstarting to get close.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                          SOME WIKIPEDIA INFORMATION\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA Broken Frame is the second studio album by the British synthpop band Depeche \nMode, released in 1982. The album was written entirely by Martin Gore and \nrecorded after the departure of Vince Clarke, who had left the band to form \nYazoo with singer Alison Moyet. Alan Wilder was part of a second tour in the \nUnited Kingdom occurring prior to the release of this album, but he had not \nofficially joined the band, and thus, does not appear on the album.\n\nIn the documentary that appears on the DVD that came with the 2006 reissue, Gore \ndescribes the record as &quot;our worst album&quot;. None of the singles had long-term \nsuccess compared to most of Depeche Mode's other albums' singles. A Broken Frame \nwas the only album not represented on 101 and Remixes 81 - 04. Prior to 2006, \nthe last song from the album to be performed live was &quot;Leave In Silence&quot; in \n1986. &quot;Leave in Silence&quot; finally made its return (as an acoustic rendition) in a \n2006 concert in Paris.\n\nThe song &quot;Monument&quot; was covered by GusGus for the Depeche Mode tribute album For \nthe Masses.\n\nA special limited edition live album based on A Broken Frame recorded at the \nHammersmith Odeon on the 25th October 1982 was also released early in 1983 which \nalso included a special 12&quot; version of Get The Balance Right on the B-Side.\n\n2006 re-release\n\nIn 2006, A Broken Frame was re-released with a bonus DVD. The CD was remastered \nand (except in the USA) was released on a CD/SACD hybrid. The bonus DVD includes \nthe three B-sides &quot;Now This is Fun&quot;, &quot;Oberkorn (It's a Small Town)&quot;, and \n&quot;Excerpts from: My Secret Garden&quot; in addition to several live versions of some \nof the songs from A Broken Frame.\n\nThe re-release preserves the album as it was originally intended. The bonus \ntrack &quot;Further Excerpts from: My Secret Garden&quot; was removed (but unlike earlier \nre-releases wasn't put on the DVD as an extra) and the version of &quot;Leave In \nSilence&quot; is the album version, not the &quot;Longer&quot; version, making its debut in the \nUSA. (Like &quot;Further Excerpts&quot;, the &quot;Longer&quot; version doesn't appear on the DVD)\n\nThere are some omissions with the re-release, including a chord at the beginning \nof the stereo mixes of &quot;Satellite&quot; has disappeared and there are live versions \nof &quot;Shouldn't Have Done That&quot; and &quot;The Sun &amp; The Rainfall&quot; listed on the DVD \nartwork that are not present on the disc itself.\n\nAlso included was a 27-minute documentary on A Broken Frame called Depeche Mode \n1982 (The Beginning Of Their So-called Dark Phase) featuring interviews with \nDepeche Mode (including Vince Clarke and Alan Wilder) and other personnel such \nas Daniel Miller and cover-photographer Brian Griffin. There is also footage of \ntelevision appearances and live performances.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       SOME TRACKS REVIEWED AT ALLMUSIC\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNothing to Fear     \tby Stewart Mason\n\nDepeche Mode's early instrumentals were consistently their weakest tracks, \nsounding more like tunes they had simply forgotten to write vocal melodies and \nlyrics for, but the sole instrumental on Depeche Mode's second album, &quot;Nothing \nto Fear,&quot; is both one of the record's strongest tunes and an encouraging step \nforward in the band's musical development. The song opens with a bouncy, \ncircular midrange riff, then slowly adds a high-register counterpoint and a \nburbling, danceable bassline. On Depeche Mode's earlier instrumentals, that \nwould most likely be that, but Martin Gore also wrote a proper top melody for \n&quot;Nothing to Fear,&quot; one that turns an otherwise passable rhythm exercise into a \nfully formed, shapely pop song. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               EAC LOG EXTRACT\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExact Audio Copy V0.99 prebeta 4 from 23.

It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and \nexpecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and \nexpressing this is legitimate.\n\nI've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ \npeople, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading \nand therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, \nbut to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused \ntools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for\nfree.\n\nIF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING \nA LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent \nalive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is\nreached.\n\nThanks\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf33fcc415b380a5af8d83bc45ed35d409713d5a","amp;dn":"Depeche+Mode+-+A+Broken+Frame+%28Remaster+2006%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D+%5BRePoPo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf33fcc415b380a5af8d83bc45ed35d409713d5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,51,252,196,21,179,128,165,175,141,131,188,69,237,53,212,9,113,61,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
