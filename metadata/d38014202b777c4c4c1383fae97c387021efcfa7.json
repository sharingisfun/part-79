Whispers of war have spread like wild fire among the Dwarves, Elves and Gnomes. What could be driving these peaceful races to the brink of destruction? Will hundreds of years of \nharmony and peace be crushed forever? In the third chapter of EverQuest for the Pocket PC, War on FaydarTM, you must answer these questions and more. Visit Kaladim, the mine city of Dwarves; Kelethin, the city in the trees; Ak'Anon, the \ncity of Gnomes, and Felwithe, the city of High Elves. Battle monsters in Butcherblock Mountains, Steamfont Mountains, the Faydark Forests, and Dagnor's Cauldron. The fate of Faydwer rests in your hands. Are you up to the challenge?                                                          \n\n\n\n\n                                          Features:\n\n\n\n* Four playable character classes. \n\n* Dozens of new monsters, weapons and spells. \n\n* Side quests that deviate from the main story. \n\n* Chests that can now contain either treasure or monsters. \n\n* A whole new story that allows you to bring in characters from EverQuest for the Pocket PC: Attack On Qeynos or create characters from scratch.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d38014202b777c4c4c1383fae97c387021efcfa7","amp;dn":"EverQuest+Episode+III+For+The+Pocket+PC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d38014202b777c4c4c1383fae97c387021efcfa7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,128,20,32,43,119,124,76,76,19,131,250,233,124,56,112,33,239,207,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
