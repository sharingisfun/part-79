Resize your images using BenVista PhotoZoom Pro 3, and get superb results through our unique, award-winning S-Spline technology!\n\nHigher Quality: Equipped with S-Spline Max, the latest generation of BenVista's patented S-Spline algorithm, PhotoZoom Pro 3 creates image enlargements of unequalled quality. \n\nTruly Any Size: Where competitors fail to get past 300000 by 300000 pixels (or even much lower), PhotoZoom Pro 3 enlarges images up to 1 million by 1 million pixels.\n\nFits into your Workflow: BenVista does not intend to dictate how you should fit PhotoZoom Pro 3 into your workflow. \n\nChoice: Although S-Spline Max has proven to be the optimum technique in most tests, PhotoZoom Pro 3 also offers two other excellent S-Spline techniques. \n\nImage Support: PhotoZoom Pro 3 perfectly meets the requirements of the professional user when it comes to image support. It fully supports color spaces like RGB, CMYK, Grayscale and Lab, just like metadata of the types EXIF, IPTC, XMP, and ICC profiles. Also, PhotoZoom Pro 3 supports layers, 16 bits/channel (including Raw) and 32 bits/channel (HDR) images and, last but not least, a very wide range of image file formats.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nOS X.4.11 and above.  Adobe Photoshop CS2 and above.\n\n--&gt;&gt; PLEASE SEED &lt;&lt;--\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddb42bc018b696f4d10211c21bcf307e6ed5a51a","amp;dn":"Photozoom+Pro+3.0.4+w%2Fsn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddb42bc018b696f4d10211c21bcf307e6ed5a51a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,180,43,192,24,182,150,244,209,2,17,194,27,207,48,126,110,213,165,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
