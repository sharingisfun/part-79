De rode draad is een moordzaak, en de detective die belast is met het onderzoek.\n\nPeople are born with good hearts, but they grow up and learn prejudices. &quot;Crash&quot; is a movie that brings out bigotry and racial stereotypes. The movie is set in Los Angeles, a city with a cultural mix of every nationality. The story begins when several people are involved in a multi-car accident. From that point, we are taken back to the day before the crash, seeing the lives of several characters, and the problems each encounters during that day. An LAPD cop (Matt Dillon) is trying to get medical help for his father, but he is having problems with a black HMO clerk who won't give his father permission to see another doctor. He in turn takes out his frustration on a black couple during a traffic stop. A socialite (Sandra Bullock) and District Attorney (Brandon Fraser) are carjacked at gunpoint by two black teenagers. Sandra takes out her anger on a Mexican locksmith who is changing the door locks to their home. Later that night, the locksmith is again robbed of his dignity by a Persian store-owner. Many of the characters switch from being bad-person-to-hero in ways that may surprise you. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy) It's a wonderful movie!\n\nWeblink http://www.moviemeter.nl/film/20709\nWeblink http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375679/\n\nVideo               : Retail DVD Rip\nAudio               : AC 3  5.1 English\nSubs                : Dutch\nID                  : 224 (0xE0)\nFormat              : MPEG Video\nFormat version      : Variable\nWidth               : 720 pixels\nHeight              : 576 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio: 16:9\nFrame rate          : 25.000 fps\nStandard            : PAL\nCover               : Yes\n\n\n*****************************************\n\nBrought to you by Juultje\n2Lions Team\n\nmeer zien??\nKom dan eens kijken op ons forum \n\n                          &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.2lions.ons-forum.nl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.2lions.ons-forum.nl&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2Lions the site to be for all your Dutch MOVIES and more\n\n******************************************\n\n\nDON T HIT AND RUN Niet gelijk afhaken als de FILM binnen is blijf seeden. \n\nDon`t quit after you finished the download, but keep seeding\n\n\nThere are fake torrents from uploaders who use our team name.\nThose are not ours, or members from our team.\nWe 2Lions-Team are not responsible for the fake posts on our name\n\nWij 2Lions-Team zijn niet verantwoordelijk voor die zieke FAKE posten die op onze naam worden gedaan\n\nPlease check our site !!!\n\nto the fakers , get a life !!!\n\t\t\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cee16997f677abe130ca6c8550b64a8d19497d30","amp;dn":"Crash+%282004%29+%28subs+dutch%29%282Lions-Team%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cee16997f677abe130ca6c8550b64a8d19497d30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,225,105,151,246,119,171,225,48,202,108,133,80,182,74,141,25,73,125,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
