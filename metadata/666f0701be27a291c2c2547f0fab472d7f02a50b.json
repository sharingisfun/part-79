If after testing it you see that you like it and it's useful for you, show your support by buying it!\n\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:666f0701be27a291c2c2547f0fab472d7f02a50b","amp;dn":"Advanced+System+Optimizer+2.20.4.762+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"666f0701be27a291c2c2547f0fab472d7f02a50b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,111,7,1,190,39,162,145,194,194,84,127,15,171,71,45,127,2,165,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
