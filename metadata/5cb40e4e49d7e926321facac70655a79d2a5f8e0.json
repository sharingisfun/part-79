Left is yes, right is no.\nChoose yes, then save.\n\nYou can skip cutscenes with &quot;Start&quot;\nOnce you get control of your character talk to the woman in white.\n(Choose the second option)\nThen go upstairs and to the far right you'll see an elevator (looks like a fence). Press Circle on it, and choose the fourth option.\nYou'll appear in another place, go straight ahear (Press up)/ Cutscene\nYou'll then appear in your room, get out (exit is in the south end/down) You'll appear in a place similar to the place before the cutscene with the guy, go back to the elevator. Choose the first option, then go downstairs and talk to the lady in white (choose the second option, first one says &quot;durr i dont understand&quot; second is &quot;i got it bro&quot;)\nTalk to the lady behind the counter, Choose second option (&quot;I understand&quot;). Then it will show you a list of two things. First one = missions 1, second is DLC.\nSo choose the first option. It will then show you a bigger list. First one is a mission and the others are &quot;Tutorial 1&quot;-7.\nChoose the first one and you'll see Mission Members. You and some dude. Press on &quot;ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â³ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â¼ÃƒÂ¦Ã‚Â±Ã‚ÂºÃƒÂ¥Ã‚Â®Ã…Â¡ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and &quot;ÃƒÂ£Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚Â¯ÃƒÂ£Ã‚ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ then go upstairs and go to the elevator(fence like thing in the center) and press Circle.\n\nCongrats, you're going on your first mission, bro. But you'll see cutscene first.\n\nYou'll appear in a different map. Now go to the damn monster and kick his ass. Have you watched Bleach? Well, now you get to pretend you are a Shinigami without Bankai hunting Hollows with your dumb friend Renji. Once you kill the monster, a timer will appear (Basically &quot;Going back to village in 120 secs.&quot;)\nIt will then show you another screen (Press Circle for Next and the other button, Square I think, was to &quot;Sell everything&quot;). Then it will show you the quest's result. (I got a SSS rank).\nThen another cutscene.\nThen prompt to save.\n\nYou will then be teleported to the elevator.\nYou can go talk to the guild sweetheart for more quests. This time Tutorial quests will be listed first. There will be 2 more quests.\n\nAnd now I go play on my own. If you need help with translations and stuff, post in a forum or something. If you need translation help post a picture of what you want translated and send me the url so I can see it.\nCheers!\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cb40e4e49d7e926321facac70655a79d2a5f8e0","amp;dn":"%5BPSP%5D%5BJAP%5D+God+Eater+%5B5.00m33-6%5D%5BGEN+D3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cb40e4e49d7e926321facac70655a79d2a5f8e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,180,14,78,73,215,233,38,50,31,172,172,112,101,90,121,210,165,248,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
