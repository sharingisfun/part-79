She mutated into the super powered tiger-woman Tigra in Giant-Size Creatures #1 (July 1974), by writer Tony Isabella and penciller Don Perlin.\n\nAfter Greer Grant's husband is murdered she has to find a job to make ends meet.  After weeks of searching, she ran into her old physics professor, Dr. Joanne Tumulo.  Dr. Tumulo was working on the human potential experiments that turned Shirlee Bryant into the super powered villainess called the Cat. Not trusting the test subject chosen by her financial backer, Malcolm Donalbain, Greer persuaded Dr. Tumulo to let her undergo the experimental treatments as well. She emerged with superhuman physical and mental capabilities. When Donalbain had Dr. Tumulo's lab destroyed with dynamite, Greer donned one of dozens of the Cat costumes that he had created and the doctor had appropriated and set out to put an end to his scheme. \n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9634ffd0d07442d1f1e9ab804b9b17d59f57cc3f","amp;dn":"Claws+of+the+Cat+%28Marvel%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9634ffd0d07442d1f1e9ab804b9b17d59f57cc3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,52,255,208,208,116,66,209,241,233,171,128,75,155,23,213,159,87,204,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
