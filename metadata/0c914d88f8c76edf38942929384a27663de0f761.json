If you are using Vista or Windows XP, there are two ways for you to protect against accidents: system restore points and backup files. Meanwhile, if you are using Windows 2000 (SP4), Windows 98 (SE) or Windows ME, every time you remove a registry item a backup file is created.\n\nProgram Shortcuts\nIncorrect program shortcuts can cause headaches! They could cause applications to take longer to launch or even stop them from working at all. RegCure finds and removes these incorrect shortcuts and improves your PCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s performance.\n\nBuilt-In Scheduler\nWith RegCureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s scheduling feature, you can just tell it when you want it to do its job, sit back and relax. You can set it to scan at system startup or assign it to work on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. You can even set up more than one schedule.\n\nInvalid Class Keys and Shell Extensions\nNon-working class keys and shell extensions can seriously slow down your PC and cause frustrations. RegCure scans to find invalid entries and remove them.\n\nEmpty Registry Keys\nUseless registry keys have no value and actually are detrimental as they can clog up and slow down your system. RegCure sweeps away this mess.\nAutomatic or Manual Repair\nYou can let RegCure do all the work as this sophisticated registry cleaner can automatically scan for and repair problems. There is also the option to take the power into your hands and manually guide the repair process.\n\nOrganizing Windows Startup Items\nBy letting RegCure manage your Startup items, you can easily improve the startup speed of our PC. You can choose which programs you wish to launch when your computer starts and you can stop unneeded software from starting automatically. As well, RegCure will find and delete missing programs in the startup area of the Windows registry. These missing items can cause countless problems.\n\nShows Scan Progress\nYou never have to wonder what RegCure is doing! With an easy-to-use interface, RegCure shows you exactly what is going on.\n\nRemoves Invalid DLL Entries\nHave you been to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDLL hell?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ If not, you are lucky. Invalid entries in the dynamic link library section of the registry can cause frustrating application failures. RegCure restores and repairs the registry and keeps you out of DLL hell.\n\nEasy to Customize\nYou can easily set up RegCure to work for your needs. It can scan only the items you want or you can establish and manage an ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œignore listÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ so that RegCure will not scan for certain items.\n\n\nMore infos at\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.regcure.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.regcure.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nThe Portable SFX EXE file is built up using WinRAR. You can use it to extract the files and check them one by one if you want to be sure of what is running on your machine.\n\n\nThis has also been built up on an XP x86 machine, I don't know if this program can run on a x64 or Vista machine. I't's up to you to check it if you are using them.\n\n\n\nSUGGESTIONS ON USING P2P DOWNLOADS\n==================================\n\n1) It's always better to run all downloaded programs using Sandboxie or a similar virtual machine until you are sure they are clean.\n\n\n2) When in doubt, scan them with an Internet Scan service as the ones provided by Jotti and VirusTotal\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://virusscan.jotti.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://virusscan.jotti.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis will ***NOT*** give you any warranty that a file passing their analysis is clean, nor that if they see them as a troian it's so or not just another false positive, but helps you to decide and at least ask for help or infos.\n\n\n3) Remember, trust nobody, and when in doubt, go to point 1) \n\n\n4) If you find any upload containing trojans or whatsoever malicious or unclean, instead of start cursing in the comments of the upload, take the time to go to the Suprbay Forum at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nand report links and comments there, and someone will take care of all the nasties.\n\n\nThat's the only way to keep TPB and its uploads fresh and clean.\n\n\nThat's for what is regarding security. If after testing it you see that you like it and it's useful for you, show your support by buying it!\n\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c914d88f8c76edf38942929384a27663de0f761","amp;dn":"ParetoLogic+RegCure+v2.0+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c914d88f8c76edf38942929384a27663de0f761","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,145,77,136,248,199,110,223,56,148,41,41,56,74,39,102,61,224,247,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
