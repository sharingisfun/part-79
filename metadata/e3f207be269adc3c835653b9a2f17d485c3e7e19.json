Trevor visits Necker Island - a family home for Richard Branson but also a luxury getaway for the super-rich. From there he sees what life is like in Cuba before going to his birthplace, Trinidad, where he enjoys Carnival, a day of colourful and noisy celebrations.\n\n\n\nThe Secret Caribbean with Trevor McDonald - E02\n\nSecond in a three-part series in which Trevor McDonald travels across the Caribbean. Today Trevor visits three starkly different islands - Musha Cay, Jamaica and Barbados. Musha Cay is owned by the famous magician David Copperfield, and is possibly the most expensive private island in the Caribbean. In contrast, Trevor is then given permission to visit some of the British women serving time in a Jamaican prison for drug smuggling. Finally he travels on to meet the man who owns most of luxurious Barbados.\n\n\nThe Secret Caribbean with Trevor McDonald - E03\n\nOn the last leg of Trevor McDonald's Caribbean tour, he witnesses first hand how the forces of nature can make some of the island's most glamorous locations practically uninhabitable. He meets record producer Sir George Martin in Montserrat to witness the devastation caused by 1997's volcanic eruptions, he spends the night on a beach in Grenada watching a leatherback turtle lay her eggs, and on Harbour Island he finds out why Prince Charles' cousin continues to live there despite the hurricanes.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Secret-Caribbean-Trevor-McDonald-DVD/dp/B001U3EOG2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Secret-Caribbean-Trevor-McDonald-DVD/dp/B001U3EOG2&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Detail average :\n\nFile size : 1.11 GiB\nFormat : AVC\nBit rate : 3 172 Kbps\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\nHeight : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16/9\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\n\nAudio\nFormat : AC-3\nBit rate : 256 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nLanguage : English\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3f207be269adc3c835653b9a2f17d485c3e7e19","amp;dn":"The+Secret+Caribbean+%282009+-+Complete+Series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3f207be269adc3c835653b9a2f17d485c3e7e19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,242,7,190,38,154,220,60,131,86,83,185,162,241,125,72,92,62,126,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
