The show ran from 1989 to 1999 (and 1999-2001 as Baywatch Hawaii). According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Baywatch is the most watched TV show in the world of all time, with over 1.1 billion viewers.\n\nGregory J. Bonann worked as a Los Angeles County Lifeguard, and started up a motion picture project about lifeguards that eventually became Baywatch. Baywatch premiered on NBC in 1989, but was cancelled after only one season because of the high production costs and low ratings. Feeling the series still had potential, David Hasselhoff revived it for the first-run syndication market in 1991, investing his own money and additionally functioning as executive producer. The show was hugely successful, especially internationally. The show led to a spin-off: Baywatch Nights, and a reunion movie, Baywatch: Hawaiian Wedding.\n\nIn 1999, an Australian version was planned and cast members travelled to Sydney for filming. The idea was to have the established stars appear in the pilot, interacting with a local life saving organisation, and thus help launch Baywatch Downunder. A pilot was filmed but the series was stopped when residents of Avalon put forth strong objections, including potential damage to a fragile ecosystem. Avalon council permanently barred all future filming, and the pilot remained unbroadcast for over a year, only to be panned by critics and viewers.\n\n\nIn Season 10, the location of the show was changed to Hawaii and the show's name was changed to Baywatch Hawaii.\n\n\n\nContent: 22 files:\n\nBaywatch.S05E01.Livin'.On.The.Fault.Line.Part.1.DVDRip.XviD-NODLABS\nBaywatch.S05E02.Livin'.On.The.Fault.Line.Part.2.DVDRip.XviD-NODLABS\nBaywatch.S05E03.Aftershock.DVDRip.XviD-NODLABS\nBaywatch.S05E04.Baja.Run.DVDRip.XviD-NODLABS\nBaywatch.S05E05.Air.Buchannon.DVDRip.XviD-NODLABS\nBaywatch.S05E06.Short.Sighted.DVDRip.XviD-NODLABS\nBaywatch.S05E07.Someone.To.Baywatch.Over.You.DVDRip.XviD-NODLABS\nBaywatch.S05E08.I.Spike.DVDRip.XviD-NODLABS\nBaywatch.S05E09.K-GAS.The.Groove.Yard.of.Solid.Gold.DVDRip.XviD-NODLABS\nBaywatch.S05E10.Rubber.Ducky.DVDRip.XviD-NODLABS\nBaywatch.S05E11.Silent.Night,.Baywatch.Night.Part.1.DVDRip.XviD-NODLABS\nBaywatch.S05E12.Silent.Night,.Baywatch.Night.Part.2.DVDRip.XviD-NODLABS\nBaywatch.S05E13.Deep.Trouble.DVDRip.XviD-NODLABS\nBaywatch.S05E14.Father's.Day.DVDRip.XviD-NODLABS\nBaywatch.S05E15.Red.Wind.DVDRip.XviD-NODLABS\nBaywatch.S05E16.Wet.N'.Wild.DVDRip.XviD-NODLABS\nBaywatch.S05E17.Promised.Land.DVDRip.XviD-NODLABS\nBaywatch.S05E18.Seize.The.Day.DVDRip.XviD-NODLABS\nBaywatch.S05E19.A.Little.Help.DVDRip.XviD-NODLABS\nBaywatch.S05E20.The.Runaways.DVDRip.XviD-NODLABS\nBaywatch.S05E21.Fire.With.Fire.DVDRip.XviD-NODLABS\nBaywatch.S05E22.Homecoming.DVDRip.XviD-NODLABS\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0f6290787efb4c2edbd6609a2ad02453f5a5cd4","amp;dn":"Baywatch+-+Season+5+%2822+episodes%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0f6290787efb4c2edbd6609a2ad02453f5a5cd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,246,41,7,135,239,180,194,237,189,102,9,162,173,2,69,63,90,92,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
