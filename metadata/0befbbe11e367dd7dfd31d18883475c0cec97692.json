If you like these performances. please pass them freely along to anyone else you think might enjoy them. I encourage you to seek out the uncompressed (.flac &amp; .shin) concerts these are from and go see these musicians perform, if they come to your neighborhood.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0befbbe11e367dd7dfd31d18883475c0cec97692","amp;dn":"Philly+Music+Club%2C+September+2009%2C+number+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0befbbe11e367dd7dfd31d18883475c0cec97692","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,239,187,225,30,54,125,215,223,211,29,24,136,52,117,192,206,201,118,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
