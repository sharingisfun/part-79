They released 2 CDep's: &quot;Soundtrack To The End Of The World&quot; and &quot;World Wide War&quot;. Both of those CDep's went out of print but were later repressed with 4 new songs on the full length titled &quot;Earn Your Respect&quot;. Dodgin' Bullets was never a full time band, and that was never the goal or point of it. DB played shows in So Cal, Erie, PA and Cornerstone Festival in Illinois.&quot;\n\nEarn Your Respect - 2002\nWorld Wide War - 2000\nSoundtrack To The End Of The World - 1999","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:959094d249efd3df3404d6969176aaa5421f4926","amp;dn":"Dodgin%5C%27+Bullets+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"959094d249efd3df3404d6969176aaa5421f4926","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,144,148,210,73,239,211,223,52,4,214,150,145,118,170,165,66,31,73,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
