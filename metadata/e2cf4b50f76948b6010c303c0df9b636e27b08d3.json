Featuring 20 tracks in total, the DVD featured footage that was traced back as close to its original source as possible. In many cases this meant going back to the original film negative, which was then digitally re-transferred and remastered. With footage shot on video, it was necessary to go back to John Lennon's original camera tapes (all on long-obsolete formats) and have them re-transferred.\nThis has been a source of contempt for Lennon fans, as the wide majority of videos on the DVD were newly made, with the exceptions of &quot;Imagine&quot;, &quot;Instant Karma!&quot;, and &quot;Woman.&quot; Both &quot;Power to the People&quot; and &quot;Whatever Gets You Thru the Night&quot; are the originals, albeit in extended form, and the video for &quot;Stand By Me&quot; has new footage inserted. The originals can be found on the 1992 compilation The John Lennon Video Collection, which as of this writing has not been re-released.\n\nSporting an identical cover to the 1997 compilation album of the same name, this DVD actually has more in common with the 2005 compilation Working Class Hero for it boasts re-mastered and re-mixed versions of Lennon's best known classics, some of which are slightly extended in length on the DVD (precious seconds that cannot be heard on any other official release). That was the major plus point, the negative was the problem which had beset the VHS John Lennon Video Collection, exacerbated here with further unnecessary tampering of the visuals, the most glaring example being the performance of the 1975 hit Stand By Me (a perfectly good live 1975 Lennon performance for The Old Grey Whistle Test was now inter-cut with scenes from the unrelated peace campaign period of 6 years prior). Lennon was always a contemporary artist describing what he was going through at the time and a man who went through many changes, illustrating these performances with chronologically misplaced footage rarely sits comfortably with the discerning fan and there are also moments of deja vu with the same bits of film cropping up in montages for other songs. In terms of rare material, there were rewards, but it would have been nice to see such treasures presented in their original context. Primarily aimed at the casual fan rather than the hardcore collector, Lennon Legend was first issued as a region 2 PAL DVD on 27th October 2003 by Parlophone, the region 1 NTSC DVD followed on 18th November 2003 bearing the Capitol logo.\n\nTrack listing:\n\n1.
