Unfortunately 'as-ripped' it sounded a bit 'flat' so I threw just about everything I had at it and now it is much better (I've been doing this for many years - try it you'll like it.) If you have a wicked bad ass stereo like I do you may have to adjust your preamp to your liking, if you have a wimpy computer stereo only, you will be able to enjoy this more like the big stereo guys! Even compared to the cd version and a remastered cd version I found, this captures much better the real &quot;late 1980's Metal feel.&quot; Very powerful, don't crank it up too much at first! I've included the original 'as-ripped' track 7 so you can compare. Please do and please comment.\n\nHeretic was an awesome band with huge riffs, bass, drums, and vocals. This album has it ALL! Unfortunately their singer moved on to Metal Church and so they had a funeral for Heretic during the church's first service...
