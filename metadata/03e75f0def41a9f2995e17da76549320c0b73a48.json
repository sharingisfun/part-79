The point was to make children think for\nthemselves, and that was probably the result. That and countless nightmares\nabout the evil janitor, Gorgon! The plot is simple. Pompel &amp; Pilt think of themselves as clever repairmen, like MacGyver, only not equally adept, and the result is always disaster.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03e75f0def41a9f2995e17da76549320c0b73a48","amp;dn":"Pompel+%26+Pilt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03e75f0def41a9f2995e17da76549320c0b73a48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,231,95,13,239,65,169,242,153,94,23,218,118,84,147,32,192,183,58,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
