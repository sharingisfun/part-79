I don't say you to donate or buy, just if you thought it's good, please keep seeding. That helps me a lot.\n\nAnd feel free to spread this torrent out to any other torrent sites, that also would help me promoting. I mean, I'd like people many as possible to listen to the album.\n\nThanks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdbbd60c74b64e7f7560f9a4b932bb3030b7b0d0","amp;dn":"Eurasia.+-+S%2FT+%282009%29+%2F+16+bit+VBR+0%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdbbd60c74b64e7f7560f9a4b932bb3030b7b0d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,187,214,12,116,182,78,127,117,96,249,164,185,50,187,48,48,183,176,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
