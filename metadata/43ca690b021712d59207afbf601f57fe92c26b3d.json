It's a visual landscape translated by our eardrums. Each listener sees their own unique vistas and composes their own stories to the rich and melodic sounds contained in this album.\n\nNature's Echo is a culmination of the experience I gained from other short-run albums. This is an aural journey from slow sonorous ambient sounds to melodic breakbeat and drum &amp; bass.&quot;\n\n1 - Forgotten, But Not Gone\n2 - Nature's Echo\n3 - Diana's Bow\n4 - 47 Seconds in the Park\n5 - Sailing the Solar Wind\n6 - Escape From Sol\n7 - Space Ship (Fusion Mix)\n8 - The Caffeinated Ninja\n9 - Tundra Exploration\n10 - 47 Seconds in the Park (DnB Mix)\n11 - Incontinuity\n12 - Still Awake\n13 - Sailing the Solar Wind (DJ Ness Remix)\n14 - Skyline (Wund3rkind Remix)\n15 - Song for Summer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43ca690b021712d59207afbf601f57fe92c26b3d","amp;dn":"Abstraction+-+Nature%5C%27s+Echo+%28ambience%2C+drums+and+bass%2C+techno","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43ca690b021712d59207afbf601f57fe92c26b3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,202,105,11,2,23,18,213,146,7,175,191,96,31,87,254,146,194,107,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
