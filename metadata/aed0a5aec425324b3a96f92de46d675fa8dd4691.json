He takes a ride in an English Electric Lightning and flies 18 km up to the top of earth's atmosphere, where he sees the darkness of space above and the thin blue line of our atmosphere below. In the Namib desert in south-west Africa, he tells the story of Mercury. This tiny planet was stripped naked of its early atmosphere and is fully exposed to the ferocity of space. Against the stunning backdrop of the glaciers of Alaska, Brian reveals his fourth wonder: Saturn's moon Titan, shrouded by a murky, thick atmosphere. He reveals that below the clouds lies a magical world. Titan is the only place beyond earth where we've found liquid pooling on the surface in vast lakes, as big as the Caspian Sea, but the lakes of Titan are filled with a mysterious liquid, and are quite unlike anything on earth.\n\nVideo Codec: h264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 9256 KB/s\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1:777\nVideo Resolution: 1440x1080 displayed at 1920x1080\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 384 Kb/s 48000Hz\nAudio Channels: 6\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 50FPS\nNumber of Parts: 5\nPart Size: 3.78 GB\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: DVB-S\n\nThis is the original 1080 PAFF TS file wrapped inside a MKV container.\nYou'll also find the PDTV Xvid and 720p HDTV versions at MVGroup.\nThese have been tested with VLC v1.0.5 and MPC-HC 1.3.1301.0 and FFDShow and Haali.\nIf you use FFDShow make sure you use the ffmpeg-mt h264 codec, not the default libavcodec codec.\nIf you use FFDShow libavcodec codec then one processor thread runs at 100%, the other runs at 0% causing jerky video.\nThe ffmpeg-mt h264 codec balances out the CPU thread usage.\n\nRelease schedule for 1080:\nPart 1: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5491759\nPart 2: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5494870\nPart 3: This is it.\nPart 4: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5501480\nPart 5: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5504057\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aed0a5aec425324b3a96f92de46d675fa8dd4691","amp;dn":"BBC+Wonders+of+the+Solar+System+3of5+1080i+HDTV+h264+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aed0a5aec425324b3a96f92de46d675fa8dd4691","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,208,165,174,196,37,50,75,58,150,249,45,228,109,103,95,168,221,70,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
