Crystal tells her about an accident between a school bus and a train in 1957, due to a problem in a railroad crossing gate, where all the children died. In the present days, there is an urban legend that if you put the car in neutral in the same place, the children will push the car and their fingerprints will be printed in the car bumper. Melanie has a cold reception from her mother, and later Crystal invites her to go to a party. When they leave the party with two friends of Crystal, they drive to the spot where the accident happened and Melanie sees a little girl. Later Mel befriends her and finds that her name is Julie.
