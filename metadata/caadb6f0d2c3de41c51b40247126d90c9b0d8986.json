Need for Speed SHIFT takes players in a different direction to create a simulation experience that replicates the true feeling of driving high-end performance cars.\n\nPlayers are thrust into the loud, visceral, intense, athletic experience of racing a car on the edge of control from the driverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s perspective through the combination of perception based G-forces, the hyper reality of the pit view, and the brutal experience of a first person crash dynamic. Need for Speed SHIFT features an accurate, accessible physics-based driving model that allows you to feel every impact, every change of track surface and every last bit of grip as you push yourself to the edge.\n\nThe all-new driver profile is the ultimate extension of the true driverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s experience. This system gives each player a unique persona based on a playerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s driving skill and style - aggressive or precise. Driver profile impacts how a player unlocks cars, overall career\nprogression and online matchmaking. In Need for Speed SHIFT, how you drive is who you are behind the wheel.\n\nNeed for Speed SHIFT is being developed by Slightly Mad Studios in collaboration with Black Box and senior vice president Patrick Soderlund at EA Games Europe. Slightly Mad Studios includes developers and designers that worked on the critically acclaimed games GT Legends and GTR 2.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caadb6f0d2c3de41c51b40247126d90c9b0d8986","amp;dn":"EA.Mobile.Need.For.Speed.Shift+%28For+All+Mobiles%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caadb6f0d2c3de41c51b40247126d90c9b0d8986","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,173,182,240,210,195,222,65,197,27,64,36,113,38,217,12,155,13,137,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
