After attending the funeral of a fifth friend who had died from a drug overdose, Ray published an eight page pamphlet called &quot;My Friends Are Dying.&quot; This pamphlet gained substantial publicity and was later expanded to a paperback book. As a result, Ray received many opportunities to speak to youth about the ultimate answer to the drug problem--Jesus Christ. \nShortly after this, Ray began praying for an opportunity to share his faith publicly. He soon learned his hometown, Christchurch, had recently legalized public speaking in the local square. Ray began preaching the gospel outdoors, and this became the daily focus of his ministry. \n\nRay has written more than 35 books and spoken at almost 700 churches. His ministry has included pastoring a church, hosting a Christian radio program, writing a newspaper column called Words of Comfort, and serving as a regular platform speaker at Southern Baptist State Conferences. \n\nRay lives in Bellflower, California, with his wife, Sue, and their three children. \n\nIf financially possible, please buy this CD/DVD to keep Christian films in business. If Christians won't buy Christian films/documentaries then who will? Infact I will say if you come across any ray comfort documentary/film blindly buy it. You won't regret your decision.\n\nPlease seed. Let each one of us who call ourself Christians seed 2-3 movies each. So that these movies may become a blessing to all those who are hungry for God's word &amp; grace. May Jesus bless all those who are seeding the christian torrents.\n\nPS: If you need any specific christian movie/documentary or have something to say then kindly send a mail to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;bfd6d1dbd6ded1dcd7cdd6cccbd6ded18d8f8f86ffc6ded7d0d091dcd091d6d1&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&quot;Don't ask me what Christ can do for you! \nHe has done all he could. \nTell me what you can do for Christ?&quot;\n\nUploaded by Indian Christian\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd8642d02d65aae1d42dbc7763313ac431e8ec7d","amp;dn":"Hell%5C%27s+Best+Kept+Secret+%28Christian+Documentary%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd8642d02d65aae1d42dbc7763313ac431e8ec7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,134,66,208,45,101,170,225,212,45,188,119,99,49,58,196,49,232,236,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
