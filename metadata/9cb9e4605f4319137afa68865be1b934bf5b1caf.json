I hope you enjoy.\n\nHow to use:\n\n1 - Make sure you have the programs 'PowerISO' and 'WinRAR'. Google them if you \nwant to install, I don't need to hold your hand for this.\n2 - Right-Click the file 'Lego RR' after you've finished downloading the torrent,\nand select 'Extract Files...', then select where you want to have the iso file\n(the one that runs the game, I would suggest the Desktop for where to put it).\n3 - Open the new folder that is there, and you should find this readme again, \nway to go champ. You'll also find the iso file 'LegoRockRaiders'. Right click\nthat file and go to the PowerISO menu, then select 'Mount Image to Drive [ ]'.\n4 - Open the file 'Setup' and follow the ridiculously easy instructions from there.\n\nSide note: I can guarantee that this works on Windows XP SP3, with Dx 10 graphics card. Anything with at least Dx 6 (basically everything since '98 came out) will have this. If you use Vista, good luck getting this to work, I can't say if it will or not. Check out some of the other torrents here and see if they have any better solutions if you want to get it working.\n\n\nThe torrent, readme, and iso files were all created by yours truely...\n\n-------------------------------------remus_xx------------------------------------\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nLegal Crap and Info:\n\n---This is simply the image file of the CD, which I do own, and only put on \nThe Pirate Bay for those of you who also own this game and would like a back \nup of the CD for your own private use, and not to be shared with any other\nusers, either physically, digitally, or otherwise. I do not own, nor\nclaim to own anything LEGO(r) related, and certainly not the rights to this\ngame. ---\n\nAlso: don't be an asshole an upload this like it were your own. *IF* the original\ntorrent is not active on The Pirate Bay, you should totally upload it, and keep\nthis awesome game out there!!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cb9e4605f4319137afa68865be1b934bf5b1caf","amp;dn":"Lego+Rock+Raiders+%5Bby+remus_xx%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cb9e4605f4319137afa68865be1b934bf5b1caf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,185,228,96,95,67,25,19,122,250,104,134,91,225,185,52,191,91,28,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
