What Really Happened is proud to be one of the oldest political blogs on the net.\nRivero runs the WhatReallyHappened radio show on GCN six days a week, and makes good use of his sharp wit to help his blog visitors and radio listeners not only to read/hear the news but to understand what IS really happening. \n\n===============================================================\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ebf947059770a29575a8e10b48846960e6f715a","amp;dn":"What+Really+Happened+-+May+22+SA+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ebf947059770a29575a8e10b48846960e6f715a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,191,148,112,89,119,10,41,87,90,142,16,180,136,70,150,14,111,113,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
