Brown and the time machine were somehow struck by lightning, and Marty was somehow received a letter from Doc that he is okay, and in the year 1885. Marty and the 1955 Doc fixed up the time machine after digging it up from a mine, then Marty discovers a grave stone with Doc's name on it, indicating that he will be killed by a man named Beuford Tannen (Biff's ancestor). Marty makes an effort to travel to 1885 to save Doc from his bleak future. But Marty does something to the time machine to not make it run, now Marty and Doc have to figure out to get back to 1985. Unfortunately, this will not be easy with Doc madly in love with a school teacher Clara Clayton, and with Beuford Tannen causing constant trouble for Marty and Doc.
