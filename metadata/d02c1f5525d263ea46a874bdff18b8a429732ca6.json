Often referred to as The Beatles of 1960ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Cuba, Los Zafiros were a Cuban musical phenomenon molded by their time and place. Best described as world music before there was world music, they caused a sensation in Havana and beyond into the early 1970ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s with their brilliant mix of American-inspired doo-wop touched with Afro-Cuban rhythms, salsa, son and other traditional Latin forms like rumba and calypso.\n\nMusic, history and emotion fuel this dynamic, award-winning film tribute from producer-director Lorenzo DeStefano. Against the backdrop of the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis, five youths from the tough musical district of Cayo Hueso in Havana decided to form a vocal group. Over thirty years after their breakup, the two surviving band members, co-founder Miguel Cancio and multiple-GRAMMY winner and Buena Vista Social Club alumnus Manuel GalbÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n, reunite in the streets of present-day Havana, a place full of unforgettable songs and memories for them and for their still-loyal fans. A stirring and definitive portrait of Los Zafiros for a whole new audience.\n\nThe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œExtraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is an hour and 24 minutes of deleted scenes, bonus interviews, Los Zafiros archival performances, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“60s Cuban television programs and commercials.\n\n\n\nMore of my music &amp; movie downloads that you may find of interest are located here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/rubusdemonoid/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/rubusdemonoid/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d02c1f5525d263ea46a874bdff18b8a429732ca6","amp;dn":"Los+Zafiros+-+Music+From+The+Edge+Of+Time","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d02c1f5525d263ea46a874bdff18b8a429732ca6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,44,31,85,37,210,99,234,70,168,116,189,255,24,184,164,41,115,44,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
