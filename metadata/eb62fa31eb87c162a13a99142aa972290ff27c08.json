It is basically from the heart and soul of us over the last 6 monthes. Holed away in the basement with nothing but our mics, guitars and mostly shirtless drummer, we wrote these songs and made sure we did everything we could to make it something we would want to listen to and play over and over again. And hopefully you'll want to listen to them an irresponsible amount of times as well. The EP recorded with John Paul Peters and will be available at all shows for $7.00 (IF YOU WANT TO GO GET A COPY).\n\nThe CD track listning:\n\n1. Wasp Country\n2. Signal To Give No Quarter (That Should Brighten Your Day)\n3. Savages!\n4. Guns In The West\n5. Demented And Sad, But Social\n\nRemember to support the band!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb62fa31eb87c162a13a99142aa972290ff27c08","amp;dn":"The+All+Night+Self-titled+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb62fa31eb87c162a13a99142aa972290ff27c08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,98,250,49,235,135,193,98,161,58,153,20,42,169,114,41,15,242,124,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
