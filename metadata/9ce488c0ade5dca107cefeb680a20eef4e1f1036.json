Dunbar listed in the number two spot for the readers pick\nBest Alternative Band everyone knows the saying, first is the worst, however\nI am not sure how they escaped third I ve seen Louis s braided chest hair\nand well anyways), I eagerly awaited for the music to begin. The three\nmembers of Document flooded the downstairs of Valentines with a wall of\nsound that swooped and crashed together like an ocean sinking a life boat\nThe singer/guitarists scratchy voice poured out over the riff rock in a\nsimilar style to Murder By Death, the kind of voice that made you question if\nhe ate or smoked cigarettes. The drums start stop flow mirrored that of the\nguitar as they danced in a flutter of delay and super shifters forming a post\npunk feel reminiscent of pre-Domestica Cursive (whom they are rumored to be\nopening up for April 20th). In an instant tribal drums sprint into action\naccompanied with an overdriven bass and a Mars Volta guitar solo that makes\nyou watch the pedal board just as much as the neck work. Each time the sound\nexplored to the edge of cohesiveness it was wrestled back by piercing vocals\nAfter the show I purchased their debut CD Empires which was recorded by\nDocument s drummer, Jeff Rendano. Jeff owns and operates his own studio out\nof Monroe, New York called Boomstick Recording. The band is currently working\non a followup to Empires and booking a tour to show it off. &quot; \n\nTracks:\n\n01  The Hells\n02  The Secret Empire\n03  Horse\n04  The Lion's Den\n05  Wolves\n06  City\n07  Beholder\n08  Ghost\n09  A Dead Whore\n10  Dorthea\n\nEnjoy, SvC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ce488c0ade5dca107cefeb680a20eef4e1f1036","amp;dn":"Document+-+Empires+%5B2009-mp3-320%5D+%5BSvC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ce488c0ade5dca107cefeb680a20eef4e1f1036","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,228,136,192,173,229,220,161,7,206,254,182,128,162,14,239,78,31,16,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
