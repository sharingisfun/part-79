There's no thought process to\n this, or to this film. Yor destroys simply because he is.\n\nHe is accompanied by the jealous, spiteful Kallah, who has some crazy 80s hair\n going on, and attempts to kill anyone else who hits on Yor. There's also Pag, \nan old man who loves his hemp. There are evil blue cavemen, and evil grey \ncavemen. It's nice that evil is color coded.\n\nIt all ends up in a sci-fi city for some reason, with the ridiculous villain \nThe Overlord, who probably likes to play Dungeons and Dragons, and some pretty \npathetic future people.\n\nBy the end of it, our hero has killed everyone who isn't him and doomed the \nentire future of humanity, as his epic 80s Queen-like theme song plays! Yor! \nHunter from the Future!\n\n\n\n\nWith a special comedic commentary by Garrett Gilchrist. Also available as an \nIriff at Rifftrax.com, in NTSC and PAL formats.\n\n\nIn the tradition of Mystery Science Theater 3000, Rifftrax and Cinematic \nTitanic.\n\n\nThis version was taped off Turner Classic Movies. It's widescreen and is the \nexact same AVI as uploaded here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4829285/Yor.the.Hunter.from.the.Future.WS.Xvid-SER&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4829285/Yor.the.Hunter.from.the.Future.WS.Xvid-SER&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSo thanks to SeriousMill.\n\nIf you've got that, you can seed this.\n\nThe difference is the added and funny commentary track.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e32792a5a5e93a1229c285acd876b5eda3fab75d","amp;dn":"Yor+the+Hunter+from+the+Future+-+with+MST3K+style+commentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e32792a5a5e93a1229c285acd876b5eda3fab75d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,39,146,165,165,233,58,18,41,194,133,172,216,118,181,237,163,250,183,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
