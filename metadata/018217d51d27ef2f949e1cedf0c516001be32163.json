It is either unusually smooth industrial or unusually abrasive ambient music (with occasional side stops in 80s-inspired Synthpop), with songs acting as soundtracks to non-existent films about intergalactic tunnel worms, Moon Fish, &amp; cannibalistic swamp hermits. Listen to it &amp; you will never be unhappy again. This is a guarantee (this is not a guarantee).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:018217d51d27ef2f949e1cedf0c516001be32163","amp;dn":"Owen+Gilbride+-+Plate+Tectonics+%28v0%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"018217d51d27ef2f949e1cedf0c516001be32163","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,130,23,213,29,39,239,47,148,158,28,237,240,197,22,0,27,227,33,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
