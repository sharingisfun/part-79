Their expert : Steve Takel.\n\nThe turquoise team is : &quot;The Top Guns&quot; consisting of Baz, Arthur and Rob. Their expert : David Jackson.\n\nThe challenge : build a torpedo &amp; destroy the opposing teams' 'battleship'.\n\n(Although in sync, the video doesn't run 'true' for unknown reasons, apologies). V6/A10  (From season 5x02 onwards, they're V10 / A10)\n\nHelp me seed (to a ratio of at least 2.0) &amp; get these 'out there' - I have a max. upload speed of c. 80k/s. \n\nThe more help I get the quicker everyone gets them. \n\nIt's a team effort. Please do your part.\n\nCreating a torrent takes seconds, uploading them takes ages. I'm going to create all episodes of season 4 &amp; seed 1 by 1, stopping at about 98% until a whole heap of you are ready to finish, saving me the hassle of constantly seeding.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbc98018720e554105bfb8e6f422579ec2fc0f4f","amp;dn":"Scrapheap+Challenge+-+04x03+-+Torpedo.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbc98018720e554105bfb8e6f422579ec2fc0f4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,201,128,24,114,14,85,65,5,191,184,230,244,34,87,158,194,252,15,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
