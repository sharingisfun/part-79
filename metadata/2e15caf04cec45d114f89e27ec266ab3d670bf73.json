Most of the source code is under the GNU LGPL license. The unRAR code is under a mixed license: GNU LGPL + unRAR restrictions. \n\nYou can use 7-Zip on any computer, including a computer in a commercial organization. You don't need to register or pay for 7-Zip.\nBut you can make a donation to support further development of 7-Zip.\n\n\nThe main features of 7-Zip\n\nHigh compression ratio in new 7z format with LZMA compression\n\nSupported formats: \nPacking / unpacking: 7z, ZIP, GZIP, BZIP2 and TAR\nUnpacking only: ARJ, CAB, CHM, CPIO, DEB, DMG, HFS, ISO, LZH, LZMA, MSI, NSIS, RAR, RPM, UDF, WIM, XAR and Z.\n\nFor ZIP and GZIP formats, 7-Zip provides a compression ratio that is 2-10 % better than the ratio provided by PKZip and WinZip\n\nStrong AES-256 encryption in 7z and ZIP formats\n\nSelf-extracting capability for 7z format\n\nIntegration with Windows Shell\n\nPowerful File Manager\n\nPowerful command line version\n\nPlugin for FAR Manager\n\nLocalizations for 74 languages\n\n\n7-Zip works in Windows 98/ME/NT/2000/XP/Vista.\nThere is a port of the command line version to Linux/Unix.\n\nOn 7-Zip's Source Forge Page you can find a forum, bug reports, and feature request systems.\n\n\nCompression ratio\n\nCompression ratio results are very dependent upon the data used for the tests. Usually, 7-Zip compresses to 7z format 30-70% better than to zip format.\nAnd 7-Zip compresses to zip format 2-10% better than most of other zip compatible programs.\n\n\nChangelog:\n\n\n7-Zip 9.05 Alpha:\n\n7-Zip now can unpack MSLZ archives. \n\nPartial parsing for EXE resources, SWF and FLV. \n\nSome bugs were fixed. \n\nSome changes in interface. \n\n\n7-Zip 9.07 Beta\n\nIt's possible to specify Diff program in options (7-Zip File Manager). \n\nSome bugs were fixed.\n\n\n\nDon't use this beta version for important data.\nCall &quot;Test&quot; command after each compressing operation. \n\n\n\nComments from the uploader (olofolleola4):\nIf you wonder why it is called 9.07 instead of a version number like 4.66, that is because Igor Pavlov has decided to give this build the version number for the year 2009. The first 4.xx version were created in 2004.\nSo that's why it's called 9.04 :)\n\n\nED2K Link:\ned2k://|file|7z907.exe|990997|803596C3C912C7E282DA2BE42CEE65B7|h=XDAX373UYE2SUZIMBO7AD4ZHUW63BWRP|/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e15caf04cec45d114f89e27ec266ab3d670bf73","amp;dn":"7-Zip+9.07+Beta+%2832-bit%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e15caf04cec45d114f89e27ec266ab3d670bf73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,21,202,240,76,236,69,209,20,248,158,39,236,38,106,179,214,112,191,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
