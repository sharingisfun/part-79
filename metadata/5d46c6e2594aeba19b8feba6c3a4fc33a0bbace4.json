The trio took a hiatus in 2007, prompting the bandmates to pursue their own projects in the interim. While David Brewis formed School of Language, brother Peter took a curveball approach to his own writing, peppering his indie rock epics with strings, piano, left-hand turns, and contributions from a wide cast of musicians (including his partners in Field Music). The songs were then recorded and packaged under the moniker the Week That Was, and a self-titled album appeared in 2008.\n\nAudio CD (August 26, 2008) \nOriginal Release Date: August 26, 2008 \nNumber of Discs: 1 \nLabel: MEMPHIS INDUSTRIES \nASIN: B001BGRZ1Y \n\n01.
