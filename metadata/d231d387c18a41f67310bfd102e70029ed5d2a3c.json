It is the second single from the album and is a direct love song between two people who are &quot;pulling apart and coming together again and again.&quot; The song was certified gold by the RIAA in September 2009 and was ranked #100 on Billboard's Hot 100 songs of 2009 list. It was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals in 2010. It lost to &quot;I Gotta Feeling&quot; by the Black Eyed Peas.\n\nThe song is present on the soundtrack of the film Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen - The Album.\n\nThere are currently three versions of the song: the full album version and two radio edits (Half Guitar Solo Edit and Radio edit), which are shorter and cuts out a portion of the song's guitars.\n\nPlot\n\nOn the March 14th episode of the VH1 Top 20 Video Countdown, the Fray stated in an interview that a video was in the works around that time. The music video for Never Say Never surfaced on the internet on April 17, but the video officially premiered on the internet only on April 24, through the band's MySpace page. It premiered everywhere else on television May 5, 2009.\nThe video takes place in one only sequence, featuring singer and pianist Isaac Slade walking through a destroyed suburban street after some sort of accident or attack. While Isaac walks through the street, panicked civilians run for safety and police officers and soldiers try to save others in the ruins. The video ends with Isaac finding a woman (played by Jaime King) who was obviously looking for him. The video ends with the two and everyone else in the neighborhood looking to the distant Los Angeles cityscape before it completely explodes. The set used in the aftermath of the plane crash scene from Steven Spielberg's War Of The Worlds was also used to film this clip, located at Universal Studios in Hollywood.\n\nLyrics\n\nSome things we don't talk about\nRather do without\nAnd just hold the smile\nFalling in and out of love\nAshamed and proud of\nTogether all the while\n\nYou can never say never\nWhile we don't know when\nTime, time, time again\nYounger now than we were before\n\nDon't let me go\nDon't let me go\nDon't let me go\n[x2]\n\nPicture, you're the queen of everything\nAs far as the eye can see\nUnder your command\nI will be your guardian\nWhen all is crumbling\nTo steady your hand\n\nYou can never say never\nWhile we don't know when\nBut time and time again\nYounger now than we were before\n\nDon't let me go\nDon't let me go\nDon't let me go\n[x2]\n\nWe're pulling apart and coming together again and again\nWe're growing apart but we pull it together, pull it together, together again\n\nDon't let me go\nDon't let me go\nDon't let me go\n[x4] \n\n\nDetails\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : Matroska\nFile size                        : 47.4 MiB\nDuration                         : 4mn 2s\nOverall bit rate                 : 1,642 Kbps\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : AVC\nDuration                         : 4mn 2s\nBit rate                         : 1,449 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                 : 1,504 Kbps\nWidth                            : 1,280 pixels\nHeight                           : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nStream size                      : 41.8 MiB (88%)\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : Vorbis\nDuration                         : 4mn 2s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 160 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 4.62 MiB (10%)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d231d387c18a41f67310bfd102e70029ed5d2a3c","amp;dn":"Never+Say+Never+-+The+Fray+%5Bmildpoison%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d231d387c18a41f67310bfd102e70029ed5d2a3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,49,211,135,193,138,65,246,115,16,191,209,2,231,0,41,237,93,42,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
