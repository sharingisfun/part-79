It started out with a scene of a Shinigami approaching Ryuk wanting to know about the human world because heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gotten tired of the Shinigami world. Ryuk proceeds to tell him about a man who tried to change the world and become god, and this sets up the recap through the first arc. Most of it was stuff weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve already seen in the original series (they even included the potato chip scene), but there were some additional scenes too.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cef9b17113759b26f079873883cff5d8ad6de32","amp;dn":"Death+Note+Director%5C%27s+Cut%3A+Final+Conclusion+%28English+Sub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cef9b17113759b26f079873883cff5d8ad6de32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,239,155,23,17,55,89,178,111,7,152,115,136,60,255,93,138,214,222,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
