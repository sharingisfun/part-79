Eleven of the first twelve tracks appear on Decade, and the disc spans his solo career from 1969 through 1992. On the rear cover of the album, Young comments that the tracks were selected &quot;based on original record sales, airplay and known download history.&quot;\n\nAmazon.com Review By Steven Stolder - One question would be: What took him so long? After all, a contemporary like Van Morrison has sold boatloads of his single-disc best-of set to buyers wary of diving into that deep catalog without a primer to get them started. So three and a half decades into his solo career, Neil Young finally delivers his version of that most modest of albums--the pre-holiday &quot;hits&quot; overview. What's surprising, coming from such a proud maverick, is its conventionality. Granted, the original master mixes are a boon for fans, but otherwise, there's not much here for loyalists who quite likely already possess the original &quot;Like a Hurricane&quot; on a couple of albums, as well as a handful of live interpretations scanning the years. Since Young cracked the Top 10 only once (1972's &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;), this set is built around concert staples as &quot;Cinnamon Girl,&quot; &quot;Rockin' in the Free World,&quot; and &quot;Hey, Hey, My My&quot; rather than chart favorites. Despite Young's honorable standing as a still-vital graybeard, the disc is skewed heavily toward his early work, shortchanging some mighty productive recent years. Peripheral fans may find this set of interest, but faithful followers are better advised to investigate the DVD version, which, at least, includes videos, photos, lyrics, and Web links.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Down By The River\t---&gt; Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse\n[02] Cowgirl In The Sand\t---&gt; Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse\n[03] Cinnamon Girl\t---&gt; Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse\n[04] Helpless\t---&gt; Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young\n[05] After The Gold Rush\t---&gt; Neil Young\n[06] Only Love Can Break Your Heart\t---&gt; Neil Young\n[07] Southern Man\t---&gt; Neil Young\n[08] Ohio\t---&gt; Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young\n[09] The Needle &amp; The Damage Done\t---&gt; Neil Young\n[10] Old Man\t---&gt; Neil Young\n[11] Heart Of Gold\t---&gt; Neil Young With The Stray Gators\n[12] Like A Hurricane\t---&gt; Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse\n[13] Comes A Time\t---&gt; Neil Young\n[14] Hey Hey My My (Into the Black)\t---&gt; Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse [Live]\n[15] Rockin' In The Free World\t---&gt; Pearl Jam &amp; Neil Young\n[16] Harvest Moon\t---&gt; Neil Young\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time\t&gt; 01h:17m:05s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 482mb (Including FLAC, Art Covers &amp; File)\nMusic File Type\t&gt; Exact Audio Copy FLAC Level 8\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Rock\nRelease Date\t&gt; 16 December 2004\nRecord Company\t&gt; Reprise Records Warner Music\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; http://www.neilyoung.com\n\t&gt;\n\t&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Young\n\t&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/y/young.html\n\t&gt;\n\t&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/neilyoung\n\t&gt;\n\t&gt;[RockinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ In The Free World]\n\t&gt;[Heart Of Gold]\n\t&gt;[Needel And The Damage Done]\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69958f4cf8b5fae342f08c0382f3ab199eb20ded","amp;dn":"%5B2004%5D+Greatest+Hits+-+Neil+Young+482mb+FLAC++%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69958f4cf8b5fae342f08c0382f3ab199eb20ded","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,149,143,76,248,181,250,227,66,240,140,3,130,243,171,25,158,178,13,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
