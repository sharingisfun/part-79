It's kind of a 'mongrel' in that every symphony in the cycle is done with a different ensemble; maybe this is why you rarely see this set mentioned at all. In any case all the readings are worth listening to, and a few (especially the 9th) rank among the very best. Sound quality is excellent mid-70's analog.\n\nLudwig van Beethoven (1770-1827):\n\n1-4: Symphony No.1 in C major, Op.21 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ London Symphony Orchestra, rec.16/6/1974\n5-9: Symphony No.6 in F major, Op.68 &quot;PastoralÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Orchestre de Paris, rec.20-22/01/1973\n\n1-4: Symphony No.2 in D major, Op.36 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam, rec.18/02/1974\n5-8: Symphony No.4 in B flat major, Op.60 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, rec.30/9/1975\n\n1-4: Symphony No.5 in C minor, Op.67 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Boston Symphony Orchestra, rec.24/11/1973\n5-8: Symphony No.7 in A major, Op.92 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Wiener Philharmoniker, rec.22/9/1974\n\n1-4: Symphony No.3 in E flat major, Op.55 &quot;EroicaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Berliner Philharmoniker\n, rec.21-22/10/1971\n5-8: Symphony No.8 in F major, Op.93 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Cleveland Orchestra, rec.01/3/1975\n\nSymphony No.9 in D minor, Op.125 &quot;ChoralÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (Helen Donath, soprano; Tereza Berganza, contralto; Wieslaw Ochman, tenor; Thomas Stewart, bass) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Symphonie-Orchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks, rec.11-12/5/1975","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0039886826c93160826697d05795d8351dc6be1","amp;dn":"Beethoven+-+The+9+Symphonies+%28Rafael+Kubelik%2C+various+orchestras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0039886826c93160826697d05795d8351dc6be1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,3,152,134,130,108,147,22,8,38,105,125,5,121,93,131,81,220,107,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
