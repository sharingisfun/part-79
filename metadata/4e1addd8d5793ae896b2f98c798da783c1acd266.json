In the German capital, all children currently have to take Ethics as a subject, but not necessarily Religion. The Catholic and Lutheran Churches decided that wasn't good enough, and launched a giant petition, collecting enough signatures to force a public referendum on the matter. Their aim: all children between 7th and 10th grade should be given the choice whether they want to study Ethics or Religious Education. The question at the heart of the matter is: who is responsible for passing on the Christian values, entrenched in German culture, to today's generations? The state or the church?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e1addd8d5793ae896b2f98c798da783c1acd266","amp;dn":"Religion+or+Ethics+%28Religion+oder+Ethik%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e1addd8d5793ae896b2f98c798da783c1acd266","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,26,221,216,213,121,58,232,150,178,249,140,121,141,167,131,193,172,210,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
