Page repeats the theme with 12-string acoustic guitar in unison. In an interview published in Guitar World magazine's November 1993 issue, Page commented on the construction of the song:\n\n    GW: ThereÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s an acoustic guitar running throughout the song. Did you play a main acoustic and then overdub an electric?\n\n    Page: No, we played it through entirely as you know it, but I was playing electric.\n\n    GW: So you simply edited out of the beginning?\n\n    Page: Yeah, thatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s right. ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“PresumablyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½. It sounds that way. It sounds like the acoustic is going straight through.\n\nPlant's vocals enter on the next repetition. He tenderly offers himself to the &quot;lady&quot; who's &quot;got the love [he] need[s].&quot; The acoustic guitars build in a crescendo toward the abrupt infusion of Page's electric guitars along with drummer John Bonham's and bass guitarist John Paul Jones' rhythm accompaniment.\n\nThrough the pre-verse interludes and instrumental bridge, &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot; stands out as an example of Jones and Bonham's tight interplay. Following the final verse, the rhythm section fades out, gradually replaced by the echo returns from Page's electric guitar and a few chords played by Jones on harpsichord. In the final 8 bars, Page executes a linearly descending/ascending sequence and then concludes with the idiomatic V-I cadence on pedal steel guitar.\n\nThe song was released as Houses of the Holy's first US single, reaching #51 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, later becoming a staple of the Classic rock radio format.\n\nHouses of the Holy is the fifth album by the English rock  band Led Zeppelin, released by Atlantic Records on 28 March 1973. The album title is a dedication by the band to their fans who appeared at venues they dubbed &quot;Houses of the Holy.&quot; It was the first Led Zeppelin album to not officially be titled after the band. It was also the first of the band's albums to be composed of completely original material. It represents a musical turning point for Led Zeppelin, as they began to use more layering and production techniques in recording their songs.\n\nAlthough Houses of the Holy initially received mixed reviews, it has since become regarded by critics as being one of Led Zeppelin's finest albums. The album provided notable additions to the band's catalogue of songs, and it has sold over 11 million copies in the United States. In 2003, Houses of the Holy was ranked number 149 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb6c857e91d4df4e1779383fb5fb1e20535eba9d","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+Over+The+Hills+And+Far+Away+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb6c857e91d4df4e1779383fb5fb1e20535eba9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,108,133,126,145,212,223,78,23,121,56,63,181,251,30,32,83,94,186,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
