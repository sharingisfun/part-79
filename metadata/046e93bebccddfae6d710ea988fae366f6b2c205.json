But what happens when the only witness is\n      also the victim? Stephanie Slater was blindfolded during her\n      kidnap but her attacker was caught because police interviewers\n      were able to help her recall the sounds and smells she\n      experienced during her ordeal. But memory can be easily\n      contaminated. Jennifer Thompson-Cannino identified an innocent\n      man as her rapist and he spent 11 years in jail.\n      \n     \n                                                      Group Notes...\n        We are looking for:                           \n                                                                     \n      .EU Affil sites, NO COLO/RENTED.                              \n                                                                     \n      Retail TV dvds before the retail date.                        \n                                                                     \n      Can't get in contact with us?
