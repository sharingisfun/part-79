My original idea was not to use this screenplay for a full-length feature - that would ruin the entire composition. The story in the film is very simple. The action takes place within one day, the dramaturgy is without sharp conflicts, it is non-traditional. Its main characters are a young worker driving a steamroller at a road construction and a young sensitive boy who is learning to play the violin. They become friends. Those two people, so different in every respect, complement and need one another.\nAlthough it's dangerous to admit - because one doesn't know whether the film wil be successful - the intent is to make a poetic film. We are basing practically everything on mood, on atmosphere. In my film there has to be the dramaturgy of image, not of literature. I offered the role of the worker to Vladimir Zamyansky, an actor from the youngest and perhaps most interesting theater &quot;Sovremennik.&quot; The little Sasha is played by a seven-year old music school student, Igor Fomchenko. I am very happy with them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59a7749b4e856363c57bf457b4bb07dfc2b70257","amp;dn":"The+Steamroller+and+the+Violin+%281961%29+NTSC+DVD5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59a7749b4e856363c57bf457b4bb07dfc2b70257","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,167,116,155,78,133,99,99,197,123,244,87,180,187,7,223,194,183,2,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
