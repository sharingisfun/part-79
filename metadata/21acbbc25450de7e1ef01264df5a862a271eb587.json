There are only 10 survivors, among them are pilot Carolyn Fry (Who has assumed command after the ship's captain is killed), bounty hunter William J. Johns, religious man Abu &quot;Imam&quot; al-Walid, Antiques dealer Paris P. Ogilvie, runaway teenage girl Jack, settlers John 'Zeke' Ezekiel and his lover Sharon 'Shazza' Montgomery and Richard B. Riddick, a dangerous escaped convict. Marooned, the 10 survivors finds the barren and hot desert-scape has sunlight from three suns. Not only they find food and water, and worry about Riddick, the survivors finds themselves being hunted by the planet's flesh eating alien inhabits, when the planet is engulfed in darkness, which happens every 22 years, as they come out on to the surface to hunt and eat all signs of life. Fry and the survivors finds Riddick is their best chance of survival, as Riddick has surgically-enhanced silver eyes that allow him to see in the dark as they set out to find a way of escaping from the planet and getting to a escape shuttle, before they all get eaten by the creatures on the surface.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21acbbc25450de7e1ef01264df5a862a271eb587","amp;dn":"Pitch+Black+%282000%29+PAL+DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21acbbc25450de7e1ef01264df5a862a271eb587","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,172,187,194,84,80,222,126,30,240,18,100,223,90,134,42,39,30,181,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
