Psilodump's\nsound may be hard to define or explain, but could be vaguely described\nas flexible, eclectic and maybe even somewhat schizoid. Filled with small\ndetails, lush melodies, mysterious darkness, complex but groovy rhythms,\nclever cuts and breaks, shifting or parallel moods, spiced up with a wild\nimagination, on the edge to overkill, Psilodump still manages to deliver a\nrecognizable &quot;Psilodumpish&quot; sound. What at one moment is lively, wild,\nenergetic, loud and hard, can the next be quiet, passive, mechanical\nand/or neurotic, if not all entirely at the same time. Simon started\ncomposing electronic music in late 1991. Although already getting his first\nrecord deal offer in 1996, it was in 2001 he got his first official release; a\nvinyl EP on the Swiss experimental electronica label Domizil, followed up\nthe next year by another two vinyl releases, one on Swedish breakbeat\nlabel Sound of Habib, and on on Swedish tech house label Q-Records. In\n2006, after numerous releases on netlabels, such as Monotonik, Kahvi\nCollective, 8bitpeoples and Candy Mind, Simon released his first CD album,\n&quot;Psilodumputer&quot;, in strictly limited quantities, on a small Swedish label,\nNinjani Diskus. Shortly after, Simon was inspired to set up his own label,\ncalled 476 Records, where he released his second CD album, &quot;Never Heal&quot;.\nSimon has also done remixes for artists such as Kraftwerk, SlagsmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥lsklubben\nand BodenstÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ndig 2000. Simon has diligently been performing his music live\nsince 1996, at both big commercial and underground rave-parties, clubs and\ncafes, festivals, culture events and demo parties. To date, he has covered\nabout 120 gigs, in 15 different countries, including France, Germany, UK,\nRussia, Italy, Israel and Spain - alongside artists, acts and DJ's, such as\nNeil Landstrumm, Chris Liebing, Cari Lekebusch, Thomas Krome, Infected\nMushroom, SlagsmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥lsklubben, Bit Shifter and Kleerup. In Sweden, he has\nperformed at notable festivals such as Peace &amp; Love 2008, Norberg Festival\n2008, Arvika Festival 2005 and 2002.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb3809b05dd51a6facaabee724ba246083ca7bb0","amp;dn":"Psilodump+-+The+Nya+Albumet+%5B2CD+%7C+Demon+Tea+2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb3809b05dd51a6facaabee724ba246083ca7bb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,56,9,176,93,213,26,111,172,170,190,231,36,186,36,96,131,202,123,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
