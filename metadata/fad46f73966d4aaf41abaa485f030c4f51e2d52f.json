The stars play a couple who attempt to grieve for their dead child by living in seclusion in the middle of a forest. But their story does not end there: in the forest, they encounter pure evil in Satan. With Von Trier at the helm, ANTICHRIST promises to be a challenging, intelligent film that doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t adhere to the conventions of cinema or religion.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://moviefox.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://moviefox.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fad46f73966d4aaf41abaa485f030c4f51e2d52f","amp;dn":"Antichrist+%282009%29+DVDSCR+XviD-NamelessOne-SyncAudio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fad46f73966d4aaf41abaa485f030c4f51e2d52f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,212,111,115,150,109,74,175,65,171,170,72,95,3,12,79,81,226,213,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
