Whilst the band's demos had publications such as Britain's 'Metal Forces' magazine proclaiming the band to be the future of Metal, the actual record once released turned out to be a rather disappointing, muted affair.\nBy 1985 the band had undergone severe line-of changes and, almost overnight, turned themselves into a Glam band, much to the horror of some of their strongest supporters, with only Manne and Tetro remaining from the band that recorded the mini album. Joining the revamped line up came vocalist Kevin Burns, guitarist Billy 'Flash' Blakk and drummer Dante 'Madman' Renzi.\nIt was with this bunch that the New Yorkers changed their name to ARMED FORCE and signed to the Iron Works label for the release of the 'Heavy Artillery' album. Tommy Bolan later joined WARLOCK.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11f741f1b80c6f555e53f914ae6a46b776d0efd8","amp;dn":"ARMED+FORCES+-+Let+There+Be+Metal+Mini+%281984+-+USA%29+-+80s+Geopha","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11f741f1b80c6f555e53f914ae6a46b776d0efd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,247,65,241,184,12,111,85,94,83,249,20,174,106,70,183,118,208,239,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
