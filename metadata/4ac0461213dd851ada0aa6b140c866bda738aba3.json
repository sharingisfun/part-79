Here's the deal, I do from 6 to 3\nin WAV, and then I can take my time encoding from quality or\ndo a quick and dirty mono 64k encode like I do for R&amp;F. \n\nFrom here on out, I'm gonna do my best to up the weekend 202 \ncontent that people want. I would really appreciate if maybe a \ncouple of peeps can tell when there's repeats and new shows, \netc -  I don't want to be upping the same torrents (I know \nWeird Medicine will run a ton or repeats between new episodes \nfor instance) and I'm not trying to make this a full time job. \n\nIn order to save drive space and encoding time (and to make \nthis possible) I will be doing live mp3 encoding for the \nweekend content. My choices are stereo 64k (muddier for \ntalk than the R&amp;F mono) or stereo 128k (CBR, a bit bulkier\nthan my O&amp;A VBR's and definitely better than any 64k). \n\nIf I was to switch to 128k (I could do 96k VBR?) for \nR&amp;F (they play alot of music, it would help in that area)\nit would be from WAV's not live (I do the whole thing WAV\nfor those instances where O&amp;A run over). That means it \nwill take longer to re-encode post-recording and could \nslightly delay my uploads. But I'd hate to be doing \nweekend content in nice stereo 128k mp3's and have R&amp;F \nin &quot;good enough for talk&quot; 64k quality. 96k VBR might\nbe a good compromise. \n\nDecide what you want. Also should I cut O&amp;A intro at all?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ac0461213dd851ada0aa6b140c866bda738aba3","amp;dn":"Ron+and+Fez+2010-05-26-R%26F+CF64k+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ac0461213dd851ada0aa6b140c866bda738aba3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,192,70,18,19,221,133,26,218,10,166,177,64,200,102,189,167,56,171,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
