Forced to live far from his homeland, Fairbanks is harassed by the wicked Henry Daniell, who has been appointed to keep the young monarch from reclaiming his throne. After falling in love with commoner Paula Croset (later billed as Mara Corday), Fairbanks decides to take on the corrupt elements that have ousted him, and he dispatches Daniell in an exciting sword duel stage in an old windmill. Many of Fairbanks' more dangerous stunts were handled by David Sharpe, who received credit as second-unit director. Filmed in black and white, The Exile was originally released to theatres in &quot;Sepiatone&quot;, a process which enhanced the film stock with a light brown tint. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039360/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039360/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nDirector:\nMax OphÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ls\n\n\n\n\tDouglas Fairbanks Jr.\t... \tCharles II Stuart\n\tMaria Montez\t... \tCountess\n\tRita Corday\t... \tKatie (as Paule Croset)\n\tHenry Daniell\t... \tColonel Ingram\n\tNigel Bruce\t... \tSir Edward Hyde\n\n\n Video\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : Streaming Video@L1\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Custom\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 27mn\n      Bit rate : 1 733 Kbps\n      Width : 704 pixels\n      Height : 528 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.187\n      Stream size : 1.06 GiB (93%)\n      Writing library : XviD 50\n   Audio\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 27mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 128 Kbps\n      Minimum bit rate : 128 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 80.2 MiB (7%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 80 ms (2.00 video frames)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 504 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.98r\n      Encoding settings : CBR\n      Language : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a770c25121790ea9816abe6bba6f612e3b1628dc","amp;dn":"The+Exile+%281947%29++Maria+Montez+Eng+%28Fr-hardsubs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a770c25121790ea9816abe6bba6f612e3b1628dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,112,194,81,33,121,14,169,129,106,190,107,186,111,97,46,59,22,40,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
