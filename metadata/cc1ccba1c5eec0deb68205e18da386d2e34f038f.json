Each song unleashes an\nuneasiness reminiscent of Korn's earliest and most unbridled material, but\nthere's also a modern refinement that's epic in its execution. Korn definitely\ndon't lose sight of their roots on 'Korn III - Remember Who You Are,' but they\nalso venture into uncharted darkness. All that truly matters is where they're\ngoing. The album strikes a balance between their past and their future, as it\nfinds the band reuniting with producer Ross Robinson, who manned the boards for\ntheir first two records, all the while joining forces with Roadrunner Records,\nthe world's leading rock label. With 'Korn III - Remember Who You Are,' it's\ntheir time...\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nInfo:\n\nLike it? Buy it!
