Through his investigation, he unearths a spider web of international secrets that has been thriving within college campuses across America for decades. His investigation takes him across the Pacific to the island nation of Taiwan, where with the help of the outspoken widow and an unlikely spy, he learns that the Professor's killing was not a random act, but a desperate move by a scandalous government intent on keeping its nefarious activities under wraps. Our detective soon finds himself on a collision course against the U.S. State Department, the Chinese Mafia, and the Nationalist Chinese Government - in a land where the truth is not what it seems and the only people he can trust, cannot be trusted at all. Inspired by actual events.\n\nCAST\n\nStarring: James Van Der Beek, Wendy Crewson, Will Tiao, John Heard, Tzi Ma, Leslie Hope, Kenneth Tsang, Chelcie Ross, Mintita Wattanakul, Adam Wang, Nirut Sirichanya, Tom Jay Jones, Ted Boonthanakit, Pathomporn Tempark, Napatcha Suthimaithee, Tonray Ho, Joseph Forunda, Tim Grimm, Jason Wells, John Marengo, Peggy Roeder, Mary Beth Fisher, Attapol Klabob, Tanada Amornpiyalerk, Wallop Thearathong, Charlie Ruedpokanon, Yi-Ho Su, Weera Lertsombath, Kittipong Subthawonpang, Henry Chu\n\nDirector: Adam Kane\nScreenwriter: Will Tiao, Charlie Stratton\nProducer: David Allen Cluck, Adam Kane, Will Tiao","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:299af6193a1cf011933143e3f7dc15049a296c6c","amp;dn":"Formosa+Betrayed+2009+DVDRip+LKRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"299af6193a1cf011933143e3f7dc15049a296c6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,154,246,25,58,28,240,17,147,49,67,227,247,220,21,4,154,41,108,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
