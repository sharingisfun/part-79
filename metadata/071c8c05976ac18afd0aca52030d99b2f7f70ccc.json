It follows a team of doctors and support staff stationed at the 4077th Mobile Army \n\nSurgical Hospital in Uijeongbu, South Korea, during the Korean War.\nThe series premiered on September 17, 1972, and ended February 28, 1983, with the finale becoming the \n\nmost-watched television episode in U.S. television history with 105.97 million viewers. \n\nMany of the stories in the early seasons are based on real-life tales told by real MASH surgeons who were \n\ninterviewed by the production team. Like the movie, the series was as much an allegory about the Vietnam \n\nWar (still in progress when the show began) as it was about the Korean War.[3] It took a number of minor \n\ncreative liberties with the actual facts of the Korean War.\n\n\nM*A*S*H - S01E04  - Chief Surgeon Who?\n\n       Frank Burns complains about Hawkeye Pierce's disrespect...and Henry appoints Hawkeye chief surgeon, \n\nto Burns's shock. The rest of the 4077th &quot;coronates&quot; Hawk while Frank and Hot Lips complain to General \n\nBarker. The General's visit provides him with a view of life at the 4077th M*A*S*H unit: camp hijinks, a \n\npoker game, and a surgery session. This shows him M*A*S*H has fun but gets the job done.\n\nWayne Rogers  - Captain John Francis Xavier &quot;Trapper&quot; McIntyre \nAlan Alda Captain - Benjamin Franklin &quot;Hawkeye&quot; Pierce \nLarry Linville - Major Franklin Delano Marion Burns \nLoretta Swit - Major Margaret J. &quot;Hot Lips&quot; Houlihan \nMcLean Stevenson - Lt.
