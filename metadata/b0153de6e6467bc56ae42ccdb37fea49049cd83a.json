Please buy your own copy if this is meaningful to you, especially if you're a Christian. http://www.callmemalcolm.com/ \n\nCall Me Malcolm is a story of the human spirit and God's Spirit, and the liberating struggle to realize and express with confidence the marvelous gift of one's truest sense of self. The film is a journey of discovery. Through his own story and through the stories of those we meet along the way, Malcolm offers us a glimpse into the real lives of real people who are transgender. But it is only a glimpse. There are many stories to be told and Malcolm helps us to make connections with our own stories and encourages us to share them. That may seem daunting in a culture which has done more to heap shame on persons who identify as transgender. But the good news in this film is that shame and fear are overcome by grace, compassion and knowledge.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0153de6e6467bc56ae42ccdb37fea49049cd83a","amp;dn":"Call+Me+Malcolm+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0153de6e6467bc56ae42ccdb37fea49049cd83a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,21,61,230,230,70,123,197,106,228,44,205,179,127,234,73,4,156,216,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
