But who protects your private data from being sent out? Little Snitch does!\nProtect your privacy\n\nAs soon as youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re connected to the Internet, applications can potentially send whatever information they want to wherever they want.\n\nSometimes they do this for good reason, on your explicit request. But often they donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t. Little Snitch allows you to intercept these unwanted connection attempts, and lets you decide how to proceed.\n\nLittle Snitch informs you whenever a program attempts to establish an outgoing Internet connection. You can then choose to allow or deny this connection, or define a rule how to handle similar, future connection attempts. This reliably prevents private data from being sent out without your knowledge. Little Snitch runs inconspicuously in the background and it can also detect network related activity of viruses, trojans and other malware.\nDefine whom you trust\nConfiguration Window \t\n\nLittle Snitch provides flexible configuration options, allowing you to grant specific permissions to your trusted applications or to prevent others from establishing particular Internet connections at all.\n\nSo you will only be warned in those cases that really need your attention.\nKeep an eye on your traffic\n\nLittle Snitch 2 introduces a new Network Monitor, showing detailed information of all incoming and outgoing network traffic.\n\nA status icon in the menu bar provides a summary of current network activity, and a monitor window with more comprehensive information pops up automatically in case of new traffic events.\n\t\n_________\n\nhow to install:\n1) Install \n2) block from internet\n3) register with serial in txt file\n\n________\n\nPlease seed and comment.\n________\n\nEnjoy!
