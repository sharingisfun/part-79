According to HMV.co.jp, the CD will be available in Japan on July 22 and will include two bonus tracks: &quot;Worth Fighting For&quot; and &quot;Deal With The Devil&quot;.\n\n&quot;A Touch of Evil&quot; includes live renderings of longtime fan favorites such as &quot;Painkiller&quot;, &quot;Dissident Aggressor&quot;, &quot;Riding on the Wind&quot;, &quot;Between the Hammer &amp; the Anvil&quot; and &quot;Eat Me Alive&quot;, as well as &quot;Hellrider&quot; from &quot;Angel of Retribution&quot;, the group's 2004 reunion album with frontman Rob Halford, and two tracks ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;Death&quot; and &quot;Prophecy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ from last year's rock opera &quot;Nostradamus&quot;.\n\n&quot;I love those songs,&quot; Halford told Billboard.com. &quot;All of those songs just crush. Because they've never been recorded live in this way, it's just something fresh to put out. And when you listen to it and think this band has been around for three decades, with a combined age of 250-something years...I mean, how cool is that? It's a very fierce record and just captures the band's attitude and feeling in a very strong, determined way.&quot;\n\nRecorded by Martin Walker and Brian Thorene during JUDAS PRIEST's mammoth 2005 and 2008 world tours, &quot;A Touch Of Evil: Live&quot; marks the first PRIEST album that producer Tom Allom has worked on since 1988 (co-producing along with the band). It was such Allom-produced albums as the aforementioned &quot;Unleashed In The East&quot;, as well as &quot;British Steel&quot; and &quot;Screaming For Vengeance&quot; (among others) that made PRIEST not only one of the premier metal acts, but one of the leading global rock acts.\n\n&quot;A Touch Of Evil: Live&quot; track listing:\n\n01.
