The group's best-known lineup consisted of Dio \n(who was at this time going by his real name, Ronald Padavona, and also doubling on bass), guitarist David Feinstein, \nguitarist/keyboardist Micky Lee Soule, and drummer Gary Driscoll. The album went \nlargely unnoticed, as did the group's subsequent two other releases, L.A./59 (issued under the title \nCarolina Country Ball outside of the U.S.) and Trying to Burn the Sun, as the group guested on \nRoger Glover's 1974 album The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper's Feast. Through their affiliation with Glover, \nElf was brought to the attention of former Purple leader/guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, who invited the entire group \n(sans their guitarist) to join forces as the prog metal outfit Rainbow, resulting in the release of a self-titled effort in 1975. \nSlowly but surely, however, Rainbow turned out to be nothing more than a solo \nvehicle for Blackmore rather than a true band and the former Elf members left the group one by one before Dio was the last one remaining until \neventually leaving the group himself in 1978. \nallmusic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\n\n\n\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Recorded live at The Bank,Cortland ,NY 1972, shortly after the band dropped the name \n&quot;The Elves&quot; and became &quot;Elf&quot;, and not long before recording the first album. \nThe sound quality is amazing, a lot of covers as well as unreleased material, and what's more : \nRonnie James Dio covering &quot;War Pigs&quot; more than 7 years before joining Back Sabbath!!!
