Here is day 12 of the May honbasho from the RyÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½goku Kokugikan in Tokyo.  \n\nThis recording was made from digital cable through S-cable, then reprocessed to 720x480 Xvid from its original *.MPG\n\nI will not bother posting the original higher quality *.MPGs this time, as many of you prefer speed over quality (not that there is too much loss in the conversion!)  As before, I will seed until the next basho.\n\nPS.  This is in the secondary language: English\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d710c44f74421824411e78fc70aff45b61e1d7ac","amp;dn":"Natsu+Basho+-+Day+12+-+2010+May+%28Xvid-%2A.AVI%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d710c44f74421824411e78fc70aff45b61e1d7ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,16,196,79,116,66,24,36,65,30,120,252,112,175,244,91,97,225,215,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
