Typical 'unacceptable' claims were the effectiveness of high doses of vitamin C, antigravity, and psychokinesis. In every case a similar story unfolded: dismissal of the claims as being nonsense or impossible, generally without any serious attempt to look at the evidence or the arguments; the non-materialisation of the honours, promotions, invitations to give public lectures and so on that such individuals might have been expected to receive given their past achievements; violent attacks by other scientists; and, for some, demotion or withdrawal of research facilities. The prestige of the individuals concerned and their continuing competence in other matters is seen as being of no moment: their unorthodox claims are perceived merely as instances of the failings to which all human beings are subject.\n\nEpisode 1 - Jacques Benveniste\nEpisode 2 - Linus Pauling\nEpsidoe 3 - Rupert Sheldrake\nEpisode 4 - Hans Eysenck\nEpisode 5 - Robert Jahn\nEpisode 6 - Eric Laithwaite","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66260072a4d8cf46d7767ea4d800e8ddaab7dd29","amp;dn":"Heretic.Series.BBC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66260072a4d8cf46d7767ea4d800e8ddaab7dd29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,38,0,114,164,216,207,70,215,118,126,164,216,0,232,221,170,183,221,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
