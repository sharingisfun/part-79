The Seasons originally recorded the track &quot;An Angel Cried&quot; in the 50's as Hal Miller &amp; the Rays. But this new version contains Frankie's most powerful vocal to date. Every track on this CD is a gem. Featuring 3 great singles &quot;Rag Doll&quot; &quot;Save It For Me&quot; &amp; &quot;Ronnie&quot; and 2 B sides &quot;Huggin My Pillow&quot; and &quot;Funny Face&quot;. It was a pity Bob Gaudio and Bob Crewe didn't create more albums like this for the Seasons, instead of relying on old standards and current trends like Dylan &amp; Bacharach.\n\n\n\n1.
