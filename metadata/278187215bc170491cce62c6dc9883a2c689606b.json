Cooper said: &quot;There's two times during the year. One is Christmas morning, when you're just getting ready to open the presents. The greed factor is right there. The next one is the last three minutes of the last day of school when you're sitting there and it's like a slow fuse burning. I said, 'If we can catch that three minutes in a song, it's going to be so big.'&quot;\n\nCooper has also said it was inspired by a line from a Bowery Boys movie. On his radio show, &quot;Nights with Alice Cooper,&quot; he joked that the main riff of the song was inspired by a song by Miles Davis.\n\nThe lyrics of &quot;School's Out&quot; indicate that not only is the school year ended for summer vacation, but ended forever, and that the school itself has been blown up. It incorporates the childhood rhyme, &quot;No more pencils, no more books, no more teachers' dirty looks&quot; into its lyrics. It also featured children contributing some of the vocals.\n\nIn 2004, &quot;School's Out&quot; was ranked #319 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 2009 it was named the 35th best hard rock song of all time by VH1.\n\nKrokus is a hard rock/heavy metal band from Switzerland. According to music website Blabbermouth.net, they have sold over 13 million albums worldwide, including one Platinum Record and one Gold Record in the United States.\n\nKrokus was founded in Solothurn in 1974 by bassist (and original lead vocalist) Chris von Rohr and guitarist Tommy Kiefer. Former Eazy Money vocalist Marc Storace joined the band as frontman in time for their Metal Rendez-vous album in 1980.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:278187215bc170491cce62c6dc9883a2c689606b","amp;dn":"Krokus+-+School%5C%27s+Out","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"278187215bc170491cce62c6dc9883a2c689606b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,129,135,33,91,193,112,73,28,206,98,198,220,152,131,162,198,137,96,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
