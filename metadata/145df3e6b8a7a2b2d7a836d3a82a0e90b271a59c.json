This was a long period of playin in a crappy over-echoey Seminar hall.\nJason (Black) who played the guitar as a hobby joined the so-called 2 member band as a rythmist. \nAt this point,Jason (Mama) was proclaimed as a vocalist for the band one evening while singing to the band's &quot;cover&quot; of Paranoid.\nThe band started forming shape when Remson was found to be the replacement for Glen,who really wasn't too keen to be on the drums. More harmony was added when Jayer filled the cracks with his Keyboard touch.\nThe same evening, the find of the century took place when Kenny (Tozo) played in front of the band, instantly amazing any innocent bystanders.\nWith the new addition of Tozo as the lead guitarist, Dunstan switched to rythm and Jason bravely picked up the base.With the load off his back, Glen stood for his interest of being the vocalist alongside Mama. We've recruited a new bass guitarist by the name of Elston, while Jason is on a hiatus in Bangalore.\nThus formed the band &quot;Please Disrupt&quot;. Now that your done reading this lift ur arse up n get our new album","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:145df3e6b8a7a2b2d7a836d3a82a0e90b271a59c","amp;dn":"Please+Disrupt+-+Nicoffein+Official+Music+Video_HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"145df3e6b8a7a2b2d7a836d3a82a0e90b271a59c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,93,243,230,184,167,162,178,215,168,54,211,168,42,14,144,178,113,165,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
