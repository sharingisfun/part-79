Oh and did we forget to mention Carbon's special morph and random patch feature,well the morph feature lets you select two sounds and then use the slider to blend the two,parameter by parameter. you can create some very interesting sound evolutions by setting the morph time value. Just to add clarity ,there is also a noise generator to mix into your sounds if you so wish. All in all this vsti is easy to use once you become familiar with saving snapshots ! just look for the little camera icon situated above osc 4.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d0572c239d4eaf82fba22363b369b4904ff50a4","amp;dn":"NI+Carbon+VSTi+AU+DXi+HYBRID+Synthesizer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d0572c239d4eaf82fba22363b369b4904ff50a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,5,114,194,57,212,234,248,47,186,34,54,59,54,155,73,4,255,80,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
