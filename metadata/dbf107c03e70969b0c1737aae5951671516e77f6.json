Erasure entered the music scene in 1985 with their debut single &quot;Who Needs Love Like That&quot;. Following the release of their fourth single, &quot;Sometimes&quot;, the duo established themselves on the British charts and became one of the most successful artists of the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nFrom 1986 to 1997, Erasure achieved twenty-four consecutive Top 20 hits in the UK. By 2007, 34 of their 37 singles had made the UK Top 40, with 17 climbing into the Top 10. Labeled &quot;the definitive synthpop superstars&quot;[1], the duo is most popular in their native Great Britain, but has also achieved great success in some other European countries (mainly in Germany and Sweden), a few states of the USA, and in Latin America, especially in Argentina. To date, Erasure has sold over 25 million albums worldwide.[2]\n\nThe band also enjoys popularity within the LGBT community, with openly gay Andy Bell regarded a gay icon.\n\n\n.ooOO ROSA MANNEN 2010 OOoo.\n                                                   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RosaMannen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RosaMannen&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbf107c03e70969b0c1737aae5951671516e77f6","amp;dn":"Erasure+-+Safety+In+Number+%28Live+The+Dome%2C+Brighton+1987%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbf107c03e70969b0c1737aae5951671516e77f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,241,7,192,62,112,150,155,12,23,55,170,229,149,22,113,81,110,119,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
