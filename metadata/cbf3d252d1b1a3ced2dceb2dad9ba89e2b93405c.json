The Highlanders, who won the Big South and were playing in the NCAAs for the second time, were trying to become the first No. 16 seed to beat a No. 1 seed since the tournament expanded to 65 teams in 1985.\n\nAmir Johnson and Joey Lynch-Flohr each scored 12 points for Radford. Wayne Ellington scored 25 for Carolina, which played without junior point guard Ty Lawson, who sat out his third consecutive game with a jammed right big toe. -- Darryl Slater\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbf3d252d1b1a3ced2dceb2dad9ba89e2b93405c","amp;dn":"2009-03-19.UNC.vs.Radford.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbf3d252d1b1a3ced2dceb2dad9ba89e2b93405c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,243,210,82,209,177,163,206,210,220,235,45,173,155,168,158,43,147,64,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
