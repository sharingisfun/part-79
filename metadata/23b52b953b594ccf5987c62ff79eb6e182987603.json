We truly enjoy seeing other   Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°\n        garbage scene groups especially in this section call out other      Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°\n        xvid groups they believe they are better than, even tho that\n        same exact group was caught in the past with proof that they had\n        been stealing from p2p as well.\n\n        We're Back!!! Ok this is out first trial cam we figured we'd put it\n\tout there because its better than the overcropped cam already out.\n\tQuality would be flawless if it wasnt for that massive flicker,\n\twhich cant be fixed through hardware, any suggestions short of a\n        new cam. Any ways the kings of the homemades have returned, this \n\twould be above our orc standards but the flicker degrades the video\n\ta little bit... time will fix that tho. And as always kids remember\n\tif you don't like any of our releases you can suck the ORC FAT ONE!\n\n       &lt;MrPricklePants&gt;\n                                                                              Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°\n       \n\n           ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23b52b953b594ccf5987c62ff79eb6e182987603","amp;dn":"Killers.TELESYNC.XviD-ORC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23b52b953b594ccf5987c62ff79eb6e182987603","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,181,43,149,59,89,76,207,89,135,198,47,247,158,182,225,130,152,118,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
