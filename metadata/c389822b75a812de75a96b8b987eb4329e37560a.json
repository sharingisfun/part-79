The woman seems to be dead, but then she comes alive before SyracuseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s eyes and he thinks he may be seeing things. However, with the help of his ailing, yet irrepressible daughter, Annie, he comes to believe that the fantastical might be possible and that the woman (Ondine) might be a myth come true. Ondine and Syracuse fall passionately in love, but just as we think the fairytale might go on forever, the real world intercedes. Then, after a terrible car crash and the return of a dark and violent figure from OndineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s past, hope eventually prevails and a new beginning is presented to Syracuse.\n\n*** 2-pass 272p encoding for computers (PC, Mac), PS3 or Xbox, portable and mobile devices (Ipod, Itouch) . ***\n*** Video is 480x272 H264; audio is 44.1 kHz/stereo AAC LC and container is MP4. ***\n\n&quot;Home&quot; of my torrents (for Bookmark/Favorites in your browser) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNOTE: 272p = frame-size 480x272 pixels, 16:9 aspect ratio, playable on all kinds\n             of MP4 capable devices/players/playback systems\n      360p = frame-size 640x360 pixels, 16:9 aspect ratio, middle-format, playback\n             as for 272p (except streaming)\n      480p = frame-size 720x480 pixels for 16:9 aspect ratio (TV) or 720x304\n             for 2.35:1 (movies/theatrical AR)\n      720p = frame-size 1280x720 pixels for 16:9 aspect ratio (TV) or 1280x544\n             for 2.35:1 (movies/theatrical AR), hardware intensive\n      \n      Most problems people have with frame-sizes 1280x720 (720p). I recommend \n      and use one system for years - CoreCodec for H264 and part of DivX7 for AAC. \n      Both are proved perfect, fastest and provide seamless playback up to 1080p \n      on new generation of computers. Newer NVIDIA graphic CPU decode H264 \n      using dedicated subroutines directly served from CoreCodec (I have ATI card, \n      just in case you've asked yourself).\n      \n      Any problems one can have come from wrong playback system, malfunctioning \n      device or lack of knowledge. \n      For instance, any so called &quot;jerky&quot; playback of &quot;system-heavy&quot; 720p comes\n      from insufficient CPU and graphic engine power or simply - overloaded \n      computer. Use of ddshow filters and &quot;codecs&quot; is suicidal. This is not \n      Russian 720p Matroska format (&quot;official&quot; 720p) and completely different \n      setup is required (extremely high bit-rates of .mkv 720p to some extension\n      &quot;hide&quot; bad encoding style). In low bit-rate H264, such as mine, \n      those errors and bad technique cannot be hidden and therefore are avoided as \n      much is possible.\n        \n      Any blurriness of video comes from less-than-recommended media player. VLC \n      and few other players are most versatile and good - but quality is 10-20%\n      lower.\n      Any block-ness comes from &quot;system-too-slow&quot; situation, when decoding engine \n      of one's device become over-capacitated and cannot process all frames as it \n      supposed.\n      On &quot;I have no video&quot; and &quot;I have no sound&quot; I don't waste my time.\n\n      MP4 is absolutely ISO 14496-1 compliant. There is no B-frames, no CABAC\n      entropy in 272p and 360p, no strange filtering and no AV weirdness \n      of any kind.\n\n      Recommended resolution for computers is 1024x768 (no matter frame-size).\n      PS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.\n      I am very proud on sound quality and hence I recommend use of stereo system \n      and proper loudspeakers (connect Line Out of Soundcard or standalones \n      with Line In of any Stereo rack).\n      \n      I encode H264 for six years and I have experienced (first-hand) any problem \n      one might have or imagine. I have heard almost every ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“complaintÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ out there \n      and would, if asked POLITELY, be happy to answer questions and give as much \n      help as humanly possible   \n      I always have.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c389822b75a812de75a96b8b987eb4329e37560a","amp;dn":"Ondine.2009.LIMITED.DVDSCR.272p.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c389822b75a812de75a96b8b987eb4329e37560a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,137,130,43,117,168,18,222,117,169,107,139,152,126,180,50,158,55,86,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
