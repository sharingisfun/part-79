The object is to organize various topics, thoughts, or any other information so it can be found all in one place. This includes Web Links, Pictures, Videos, PDF, MS Word, and basically anything else you could think of. Using this program will allow people who have tasks that need help organizing like uploading torrents, studying, or even work related business, it can all be done through this elaborate and intuitive software.\n\nI Highly recommend this for anyone who needs to keep track of anything with priority.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPersonal Brain - The Brain Visual Information Enhancement\n\n5.5.2.3\n\nWebsite: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thebrain.com/#-50&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thebrain.com/#-50&lt;/a&gt;\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout TheBrain\n\nTheBrain Technologies is the leading provider of visual content management solutions. The company was founded in 1996 and has been delivering award-winning information management solutions for over a decade. By connecting people, processes, and information, TheBrain's products provide unparalleled context for smarter information discovery and more informed decision-making.\n\nTheBrain technology can be utilized on corporate intranets, desktops, and the Internet. Some applications include: customer care, project management, dynamic mind mapping, IT management and helpdesks, impact assessment, competitive intelligence, marketing and sales support, and personal information management.\n\n\n\nHelping People See Connections\n\nConnections and relationships within your information make the difference between static content and actionable knowledge. For instance, sales personnel need to see how decision makers are connected to close a deal. Business managers need to see how brands and products fit into their industry landscape to make decisions. IT managers need to see relationships between their servers and applications to support user communities effectively. People need to understand the context of their information before taking action.\n\n\n\nContainers Versus Links\n\nConventional file directory trees confine information to a strict hierarchical organization and are incapable of expressing the multi-layered relationships that exist in the real world.\n\nThese systems are incapable of expressing relationships the way you naturally think about them. TheBrain takes the opposite approach-it enables you to link information into a network of logical associations.\n\n\n\nThe Power of Association\n\nTheBrain is an associative information organization system-any piece of information can be linked to any other piece. The power of TheBrain lies in the flexibility of these links. You can quickly create structures of information that reflect the way you think about your information. Each item triggers related items, bringing relevant information together as you need it.\n\n\n\nVisualizing Information Flow\n\nPieces of information in TheBrain are called &quot;Thoughts,&quot; which can represent files, Web pages, people, and ideas. TheBrain's display is organized around a central Thought, surrounded by all its related Thoughts.\n\nClicking on any Thought brings it to the center of the display. As you navigate through data, the information displayed on the screen is always related to the selected data. TheBrain lets you follow a train of Thought, flowing from one item to the next.\n\n===================================================================================\n-Conceptual storage and access to information through an intuitive, simple interface. So no more drilling up and down through file and folder hierarchies!\n\n-Integrated access to all your documents, Web pages, spreadsheets, presentations, PDF files and more!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHASH CHECK CODE: DA70179117A3F332E7C15DEDC56807E6E65127CE\n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da70179117a3f332e7c15dedc56807e6e65127ce","amp;dn":"PersonalBrain+v+5.5.2.3++w%2FKeymaker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da70179117a3f332e7c15dedc56807e6e65127ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,112,23,145,23,163,243,50,231,193,93,237,197,104,7,230,230,81,39,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
