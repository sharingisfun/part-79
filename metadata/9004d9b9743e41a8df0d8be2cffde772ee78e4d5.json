He compared Gloriana to Little Big Town, another country group with four part harmonies and said, &quot;ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s easy to like songs like this, even if the lyrics donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t really say too much in the way of insightful messages, we all need and like to hear feel-good songs every once in a while.&quot;\n\nThe song became the best-selling country music debut single in 2009.\n\n&quot;Wild at Heart&quot; debuted at #54 on the Hot Country Songs chart in February 2009.
