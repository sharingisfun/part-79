But Blane runs with a fast crowd of haughty rich kids, the kind of clique Andie and her new wavy best friend Duckie (Jon Cryer) can't stand. Going against her fretting father (Harry Dean Stanton), peer pressure and social expectations, she decides to date him. But their big plans for the senior prom ultimately fall apart when Blane heeds his friend Steff's (James Spader) warning to &quot;quit slumming.&quot; Will Blane find the courage to claim what he really wants and give up the so-called friends he doesn't need?\nThis classic 1980s teen film from the master of the genre, writer-producer John Hughes features plenty of great '80s pop tunes from the Psychedelic Furs, The Smiths, Echo and The Bunnymen, New Order, and more. The continued success of Hughes' films and actors ushered in the era of the &quot;brat pack&quot; and teen films as pop culture.\n\n  \n  \n Widescreen - 16:9 \n Audio:\n Dolby Digital 2.0 - English, French \n Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround - English \n Subtitles - English \n\n \n Additional Release Material:\n Audio Commentary - Howard Deutch - Director \n Featurettes 1. &quot;The First Time: The Making of Pretty in Pink&quot; \n 2. &quot;Zoids and Richies&quot; \n 3. &quot;Prom Queen: All About Molly&quot; \n 4. &quot;Volcanic Ensembles&quot; \n 5. &quot;Prom Stories&quot; \n 6. &quot;The Lost Dance: The Original Ending&quot; \n 7. &quot;Wrap Up: The Epilogue&quot; \n\n \n \n Technical Info\n \n\nRelease Information\n \n Studio: Paramount \n Release Date: 1/16/2007 \n Running Time: 96.6833333333333 minutes \n Original Release Date: 1986 \n Number of Discs: 1 \n\nAudio &amp; Video\n \n Original Language: English \n Available Audio Tracks: English \n Video: Color \n \n\nFeatures: DVD, Collector's Edition, Dolby, Dolby Digital (5.1)\n \n\nCast &amp; Crew \n Molly Ringwald\n Andrew McCarthy \n Annie Potts \n Harry Dean Stanton \n James Spader \n Jon Cryer \n Howard Deutch - Director \n Tak Fujimoto - Director of Photography \n Richard Marks - Editor \n Michael Gore - Musical Score \n Jane Vickerilla - Producer \n Lauren Shuler Donner - Producer \n John Hughes - Producer \n John W.
