Less well known but worthwhile cuts include by-definition-camp &quot;Krisco Kisses&quot; and &quot;The Only Star in Heaven,&quot; while U.K. smash &quot;The Power of Love&quot; is a gloriously insincere but still great hyper-ballad with strings from Anne Dudley. In truth, the album's more a testament to Trevor Horn's production skills than anything else. To help out, he roped in a slew of Ian Dury's backing musicians to provide the music, along with a guest appearance from his fellow Yes veteran Steve Howe on acoustic guitar that probably had prog rock fanatics collapsing in apoplexy. The end result was catchy, consciously modern ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ almost to a fault ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ arena-level synth rock of the early '80s that holds up just fine today, as much an endlessly listenable product of its times as the Chinn/Chapman string of glam rock hits from the early '70s. Certainly the endless series of pronouncements from a Ronald Reagan impersonator throughout automatically date the album while lending it a giddy extra layer of appeal. Even the series of covers on the album at once make no sense and plenty of it all at once. While Edwin Starr's &quot;War&quot; didn't need redoing, Bruce Springsteen's &quot;Born to Run&quot; becomes a ridiculously over-the-top explosion that even outrocks the Boss. As the only member of the band actually doing anything the whole time (Paul Rutherford pipes up on backing vocals here and there), Holly Johnson needs to make a mark and does so with appropriately leering passion. He didn't quite turn out to be the new Freddie Mercury, but he makes a much better claim than most, combining a punk sneer with an ear for hyper-dramatic yelps.&quot;\n\nAllmusic.com review 'Liverpool':\n&quot;Frankie Goes to Hollywood's first double album was a huge hit. Their second offering also met with some success, although it is not as well remembered. And yet, on many accounts, Liverpool can be considered as an improvement over its predecessor. For one thing, the album is shorter, more conventional. While Welcome to the Pleasuredome had some strong material, the length weakened the whole in many places. Here, the band focused on eight tracks and the result is somewhat more convincing. &quot;Warriors of the Wasteland,&quot; &quot;Rage Hard,&quot; and &quot;Watching the Wildlife&quot; were all minor hits back in 1986, and the other tracks are, for the most part, of the same quality, with perhaps &quot;For Heaven's Sake&quot; standing out as a favorite. Again, Trevor Horn was involved in the production (the band was signed to his famous Zang Tuum Tumb label, so it's no big surprise) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ thus the production is impeccable, as one would expect from a Horn-produced album. Worth a listen if you like the band or have an interest for '80s music ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ of which this is not such a bad sample.&quot;\n\nTRACK LIST\n\nWelcome to the Pleasuredome [1984]\n===================================\n\nAll songs written by Peter Gill/Holly Johnson/Brian Nash/Mark O'Toole, unless otherwise noted.\n\nSide 1 (&quot;F - Pray Frankie Pray&quot;)\n01. &quot;Well...&quot; (Gill/Johnson/Nash/O'Toole/Andy Richards) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:55 \n02. &quot;The World Is My Oyster&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:02 \n03. &quot;Snatch of Fury (Stay)&quot; (Gerry Marsden) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:36 \n04. &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 12:58 \n\nSide 2 (&quot;G - Say Frankie Say&quot;)\n05. &quot;Relax (Come Fighting)&quot; (Gill/Johnson/O'Toole) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56 \n06. &quot;War (...and Hide)&quot; (Barrett Strong/Norman Whitfield) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:12 \n07. &quot;Two Tribes (For the Victims of Ravishment)&quot; (Gill/Johnson/O'Toole) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:23 \n08. &quot;(Tag)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:35 \n\nSide 3 (&quot;T - Stay Frankie Stay&quot;)\n09. &quot;Fury (Go)&quot; (Gerry Marsden) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:49 \n10. &quot;Born to Run&quot; (Bruce Springsteen) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56 \n11. &quot;San JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© (The Way)&quot; (Burt Bacharach/Hal David) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:09 \n12. &quot;Wish (The Lads Were Here)&quot; (Gill/Johnson/O'Toole) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:48 \n13. &quot;Including The Ballad of 32&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:47 \n\nSide 4 (&quot;H - Play Frankie Play&quot;)\n14. &quot;Krisco Kisses&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:57 \n15. &quot;Black Night White Light&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05 \n16. &quot;The Only Star in Heaven&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:16 \n17. &quot;The Power of Love&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:28 \n18. &quot;Bang...&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:08 \n\n\nLiverpool [1986]\n=================\n\nAll songs written by Peter Gill/Holly Johnson/Brian Nash/Mark O'Toole.\n\n01. &quot;Warriors of the Wasteland&quot;  - 4:58  \n02. &quot;Rage Hard&quot;  - 5:02  \n03. &quot;Kill the Pain&quot;  - 6:16  \n04. &quot;Maximum Joy&quot; - 5:32 \n05. &quot;Watching the Wildlife&quot;  - 4:18  \n06. &quot;Lunar Bay&quot;  - 5:42  \n07. &quot;For Heaven's Sake&quot;  - 4:29  \n08. &quot;Is Anybody Out There?&quot;  - 7:25 \n \n \nPlus [1983-1987]\n=================\n\n01. &quot;Relax&quot; (Sex Mix) - 16:23\n02. &quot;Relax&quot; (U.S. Mix) - 7:24\n03. &quot;Ferry 'Cross the Mersey&quot;  - 4:05\n04. &quot;One September Monday&quot; - 4:50\n05. &quot;Two Tribes (Cowboys and Indians)&quot; - 3:56\n06. &quot;Two Tribes (We Don't Want to Die)&quot; - 4:12\n07. &quot;Two Tribes (Annihilation)&quot; - 9:07\n08. &quot;The Last Voice&quot; - 1:14\n09. &quot;Two Tribes (Carnage)&quot; - 7:56\n10. &quot;Two Tribes (Hibakusha)&quot; - 6:36\n11. &quot;One February Friday&quot; - 4:57\n12. &quot;War (Hide Yourself)&quot; - 4:15\n13. &quot;War (Hidden)&quot; - 8:33\n14. &quot;The Power of Love&quot; (Extended Mix) - 9:30\n15. &quot;The Power of Love&quot; (Holier Than Thou Edit) - 3:30 \n16. &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome (Altered Real)&quot; - 4:25\n17. &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome (Alternative Reel)&quot; - 5:10\n18. &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome (Real Altered)&quot; - 9:40\n19. &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome (Fruitness)&quot; - 12:13\n20. &quot;Happy Hi!&quot; - 4:12\n21. &quot;Disneyland&quot; - 3:06\n22. &quot;Rage Hard&quot; (7 Inch Mix) - 5:06\n23. &quot;Rage Hard&quot; (12 Inch Mix) - 12:08\n24. &quot;Rage Hard&quot; (Broad) - 8:30\n25. &quot;Rage Hard&quot; (Stamped) - 5:01\n26. &quot;Rage Hard&quot; (Freddie Bastone Vocal Remix) - 7:01\n27. &quot;(Don't Lose What's Left) of Your Little Mind (Suffer Brother)&quot; - 6:15\n28. &quot;SuffeRAGEtte City&quot; - 3:33\n29. &quot;Warriors (of the Wasteland)&quot; - 3:56\n30. &quot;Warriors of the Wasteland&quot; (Twelve Wild Disciples Mix) - 9:43\n31. &quot;Warriors of the Wasteland&quot; (Turn of the Knife Mix) - 8:09\n32. &quot;Warriors of the Wasteland&quot; (Attack) - 9:54\n33. &quot;Watching the Wildlife&quot; (Hotter) - 9:08\n32. &quot;Beobachtungen im Wilden Leben (Die Letzen Tage der Menschheit)&quot; - 10:13\n\n&quot;...all nice boys love sea men...&quot;\n\n\nEnjoy and share.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c19c05f820e0b261f9b3877a44f32cc8a92ed42","amp;dn":"FRANKIE+GOES+TO+HOLLYWOOD+-+Pleasuredome+%26+Liverpool+%5B320+kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c19c05f820e0b261f9b3877a44f32cc8a92ed42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,25,192,95,130,14,11,38,31,155,56,119,164,79,50,204,138,146,237,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
