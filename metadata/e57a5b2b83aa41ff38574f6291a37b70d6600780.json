As Jacob becomes more immersed in the secular life of Kohor's house, Laneah becomes more interested in the humble faith he is forsaking.\nHer conversion to Christ, and the death of Amaron at the hand of Kohor's men, brings Jacob to his senses, but he knows of Kohor's plans and is imprisoned when he refuses to join the conspiracy.\n\nIn Jerusalem, Jesus is crucified and the far away city of Zarahemla is plunged into darkness and destruction as Helam pushes through the crowds and ruins to help his son.\nAll seems hopeless when he is blinded, has not found Jacob, and thinks that he failed in  his quest to see The Messiah.\n\n===========================================================================\n\nFile Format\n-----------\n\nLanguages: 12 Audio Languages + ASL (English Audio Not Included)\nGERMAN\nSPANISH\nFRENCH\nITALIAN\nPORTUGUESE\nFINNISH\nRUSSIAN\nUCRANIAN\nJAPANESE\nKOREAN\nCHINESE (A)\nCHINESE (B)\n\nSubtitles: 7 Language Subtitles\nENGLISH\nSDH\nDANISH\nHOLLANDISCH\nNORWEGIAN\nFINNISH\nSWEDISH\n\nDuration: 67 Minutes\nType: DVD\nFile Extension: .iso (Burn in a DVD or Mount on Virtual Drive)\n\nVideo\nCodec: MPEG-1/2\nResolution: 720 x 480\nFrame Rate: 60 FPS\nFormat: 16:9 Widescreen\nAspect Ratio: 1.85 : 1\n\nAudio:\nCodec: Dolby Digital AC3\nChannels: 2 (Stereo) + AC3\nSample rate: 48000 Hz\nBitrate: 192 kb/s\n\n===========================================================================\n\nOther Movies in Varius Languages and Versions - Otras PelÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­culas en Varias Versiones e Idiomas\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThe Testaments of one Fold and one Shepherd\nMultilanguage Full DVD Version (English Audio Not Included)/ VersiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n DVD Multidioma\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5655571\n\nThe Testaments of one Fold and one Shepherd\nEnglish Audio Version / VersiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n con Audio en Ingles\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5650100\n\nThe Testaments of one Fold and one Shepherd\nSpanish Audio Version / VersiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n con Audio en EspaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ol\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5654010\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThe Work and the Glory - Full Trilogy\nEnglish Audio Version / VersiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n con Audio en Ingles\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5663012\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nO Outro Lado do Ceu\nPortuguese Audio\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5676680\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nPassage to Zarahemla Movie DVD (English Ingles - EspaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ol Spanish)\nMultilanguage Full DVD Version English Audio - Spanish Optinal Subtitles/ VersiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n DVD Multidioma\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5662897","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e57a5b2b83aa41ff38574f6291a37b70d6600780","amp;dn":"The+Testaments+of+One+Fold+and+One+Shepherd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e57a5b2b83aa41ff38574f6291a37b70d6600780","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,122,91,43,131,170,65,255,56,87,79,98,145,163,123,112,214,96,7,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
