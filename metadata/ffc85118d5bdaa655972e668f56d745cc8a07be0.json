The series sees the characters struggling against terrible dangers in a world with no society, no police and no law and order led by the de facto mother of the group, Abby Grant.\n\nSurvivors.S01.DVDRip.XviD-HAGGiS\n\nSurvivors.S01E01.DVDRip.XviD-HAGGiS\n\nOrginal Airdate: 23 November 2008\n\nAs the &quot;European Flu&quot; virus spreads throughout the world, governments realise the scale of the problem. After a few days of the virus spreading, people fall ill, including Abby Grant, Jenny Collins and her friend Patricia. The Government Minister in charge of the pandemic is told that at least 90% of the world's population will die but it slowly becomes apparent that the situation is a lot worse than that. When Al Sadiq, Greg Preston, Najid and Tom Price wake up, they find everyone around them is dead and struggle to find any other survivors. Abby wakes up from her illness, to find that her husband did not survive and searches the country for her missing son. Eventually, the characters meet and realise they are going to have to stick together to survive.\n\nAVI Information\n\nFilename: Survivors.S01E01.DVDRip.XviD-HAGGiS.avi\nFilesize: 730705920 Bytes (696.86 MB)\nStreams (i.e. Video, Audio): 2\n\nVideo Stream\n\nCompression: xvid - XVID MPEG-4\nAvg.

After she meets Bob again, Sarah makes a fateful decision to betray Anya to Samantha, while Najid goes missing in the city, and the others look for him. While there, he meets Darren, a feral boy, and a community of other children under the protection of Craig and June, a sinister couple of adults. Greg is shot by one of the thugs from episode two that Samantha has recently recruited, and Abby is kidnapped by a squad of armed men from &quot;the laboratory&quot;. This leaves the series in a cliffhanger situation. After these events, a young boy is handed a bag of belongings marked Peter Grant, and a horserider is shown looking for him. Is this Abby's son, Peter?\n\nAVI Information\n\nFilename: Survivors.S01E06.DVDRip.XviD-HAGGiS.avi\nFilesize: 574502912 Bytes (547.89 MB)\nStreams (i.e. Video, Audio): 2\n\nVideo Stream\n\nCompression: xvid - XVID MPEG-4\nAvg.
