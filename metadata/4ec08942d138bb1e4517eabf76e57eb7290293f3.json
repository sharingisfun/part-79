Shining Star was Earth, Wind &amp; Fire's first major hit, hitting #1 on both the U.S. Hot 100 and R&amp;B charts. The song is considered a prime example of funk music that has attained mainstream success.\n\n&quot;Shining Star&quot; has been remade by the Christian metal band Stryper on their 1990 album Against the Law, Chaka Khan on the tribute album Interpretations: Celebrating the Music of Earth, Wind &amp; Fire and also by Yolanda Adams.\n\nStryper is a Christian metal band from Orange County, California, USA. Formed in 1983, they are pioneers in the mainstream popularization of Christian metal music. Stryper enjoyed great success during the mid-late 1980s, with one Platinum and two Gold records, before breaking up in 1992 at a time when most metal (especially glam metal) groups of the 1980s were losing popularity. However, the band reunited in 2003 and since have released two new studio albums.\n\nThe name &quot;Stryper&quot; derives from the King James Version of Isaiah 53:5:\n\n&quot;But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.&quot;\n\nThe scriptural reference is also part of Stryper's logo on most of their releases. (They also incorporate stripes into most of their outfits and their logo.) Once the band embraced the name of Stryper, drummer Robert Sweet created a backronym which is: Salvation Through Redemption, Yielding Peace, Encouragement, and Righteousness.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ec08942d138bb1e4517eabf76e57eb7290293f3","amp;dn":"Stryper+-+Shining+Star","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ec08942d138bb1e4517eabf76e57eb7290293f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,192,137,66,209,56,187,30,69,23,234,191,118,229,126,183,41,2,147,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
