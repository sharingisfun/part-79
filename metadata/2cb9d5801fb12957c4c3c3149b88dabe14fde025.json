Today, an estimated 1% of the world's population possesses psychic abilities.  These people are not super-heroes.  In most ways, they're just ordinary people, living ordinary lives.  They have families, careers, and dreams; they eat, sleep, live... and die.  One such person is precognitive Detective Owen Young. When a secret he's kept for years - a secret that could send not only him, but many of his friends to prison - falls into the hands of an opportunistic criminal he faces a terrible decision.\n\nPublished by Image Comics, written by Jason Rand and illustrated by Juan Ferreyra (Rex Mundi).\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cb9d5801fb12957c4c3c3149b88dabe14fde025","amp;dn":"Small+Gods","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cb9d5801fb12957c4c3c3149b88dabe14fde025","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,185,213,128,31,177,41,87,196,195,195,20,155,136,218,190,20,253,224,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
