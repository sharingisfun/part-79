It was interesting how they got into the thoughts of the serial killer. This just wasn't a guy with a knife killing teens in the woods. Technically this indie movie was as good as any Hollywood film. The acting was okay. The actress that played the mother was really scary. There are some nice kills in the movie. The story had great twists on the usual slasher stuff and my friend kept quoting one line from the movie &quot;Stabbing a person is just rude!&quot; Basement Jack is definitely as cool as Jason, Michael and Freddy. I stayed for the Q &amp; A afterwards, which I never do, and found the filmmakers were very friendly and informative. I hope this comes to DVD soon. All true horror fans will like Basement Jack.
