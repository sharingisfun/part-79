IRA K ORGANIZATION, an industrial noise one mand band from Italy, was the last performance on Sunday, and the very last of the festival. \nFew notes about the festival from \n\nwww.moonlightfestival.com\n\n&quot; Moonlight Festival a three days festival which will offer music in its various forms.\nThe festival will take place on the Adriatic sea, near Rimini, in a beautiful town called Fano by the seaside with antiques buildings, a place full of history.\nThe festival will be completely free, music has to be given tv everybody : thant's why at the entrance a drop box will be placed, so the audience opionally can offer some money and the takings of every event will be given to charity to the &quot;oasi dell'accoglienza&quot;, an organisation which give help to unlucky children.\nThat's the main conception of Fano Moonlight Festival : bring leisure and charity together.\nThe decision to organize a free music festival depends from the will to involve young people to music without being conditioned by money at all.\nFano Moonlight Festival is culture too, walking between the three locations of the festival, the audience will be able to appreciate italian history and culture thanks to turistic itineraries (see Fano section and then Tourism section on this site)\nIt will be a &quot;music full immersion festival&quot;: every activity will start from morning with music conferences and workshops, concerts, in the afternoon concerts and djsets on the seaside and in the evening headliners' shows and djset in a great location on the sea, under the moonlight.\nFano Moonlight Festival will present the main artists who have made and still make today the history of new wave, electronic and gothic music.\nCulture, history, juvenile gathering, knowledge of the country wrapped together by a key word : music.\nIt's a total new and first event in Italy, and the idea of this project is created by &quot;Fano Moonlight Association&quot;, a cultural no profit association based in Fano&quot;\n\n==============\n\nBands that I have filmed ( you'll see every dvd here asap).
