For years, he has applied to become a cop, but   \n he always fails the physical exam because he is overweight. One day, a gang  \n of organized criminals put the mall under siege and take hostages. Blart     \n becomes trapped inside, and because of his sense of duty, refuses to leave.  \n He thus becomes the police department's eyes on the inside and attempts to   \n stop the criminals on his own.                                               \n                                                                              \n\n\n                           Happy Hacker Industries                            \nThis movie should play fine on most DVD/DivX Certified settop\ndvd players.
