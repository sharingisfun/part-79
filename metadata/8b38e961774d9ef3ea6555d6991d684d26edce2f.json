Here is day 08 of the May honbasho from the RyÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½goku Kokugikan in Tokyo.\n  \nThis recording was made from digital cable through S-cable, then reprocessed to 720x480 Xvid from its original *.MPG\n\nI will not bother posting the original higher quality *.MPGs this time, as many of you prefer speed over quality (not that there is too much loss in the conversion!)  As before, I will seed until the next basho.\n\n\nPS.  This is in the secondary language: English\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b38e961774d9ef3ea6555d6991d684d26edce2f","amp;dn":"Natsu+Basho+-+Day+08+-+2010+May+%28Xvid-%2A.AVI%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b38e961774d9ef3ea6555d6991d684d26edce2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,56,233,97,119,77,158,243,234,101,85,214,153,29,104,77,38,237,206,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
