How hard would you fight and what would you sacrifice to keep it from coming true? When an unexplained, cataclysmic event knocks out the entire population of the world at the exact same moment, for two minutes and 17 seconds, everyone will see a glimpse of their own future. Then they will wake up to chaos. From his flash forward, LA FBI Agent Mark Benford is able to piece together the 'when' April 29, 2010, but he's desperate to figure out the 'why' and stop what's coming because it's a future he doesn't want to see. In the future, Mark's beloved wife has left him for the father of one of her patients. He's started drinking again, his loyal partner's been murdered and masked operatives are hunting him down. Before long, everyone starts asking themselves and each other, &quot;What did you see?&quot; As Mark and his team struggle to figure out what caused this bizarre event and wonder will it happen again, the only thing they have to go on is a huge mosaic of people's flash forwards.\n\nCast:\n\nJoseph Fiennes as Mark Benford\nJohn Cho as Demetri Noh\nJack Davenport as Lloyd Simcoe\nZachary Knighton as Bryce Varley\nPeyton List as Nicole\nDominic Monaghan as Simon\nBrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­an F.
