The song proved to be a success, giving Braxton her first U.S. Billboard Hot 100 top ten hit (number seven) and her first Adult Contemporary hit (number eight), and narrowly missing the top position of the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs by peaking at number two, being held from the summit by SWV's &quot;Right Here/Human Nature&quot;/&quot;Downtown&quot;. Internationally, &quot;Another Sad Love Song&quot; reached number fifteen in the United Kingdom, number twenty-three in the Netherlands, and number sixty in Germany.\n\nThe music video was released in two different versions. The first version was filmed in black-and-white and featured the original music. The second version was filmed in color and was remixed to appeal to a wider audience. Both versions were successful and stayed in heavy rotation during the summer of 1993.\n\n&quot;Another Sad Love Song&quot; earned Braxton her first Grammy Award, for Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance, Female in 1994.\n\nToni Braxton is the self-titled debut album by American R&amp;B singerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“songwriter Toni Braxton, released in the United States on July 13, 1993 by LaFace Records.
