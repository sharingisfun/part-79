The clever and occasionally ridiculous lyrics and arrangements that were the hallmarks of Trip Shakespeare songs were retired with the band, and as this album makes clear, Wilson has refined a more sophisticated but no less exciting sound. From the gorgeous guitar and revitalizing chorus of the opening track &quot;Sun Is Coming,&quot; to the wistful acoustic answering machine ballad that closes the album (&quot;Hello Caller&quot;), Burnt, White and Blue is wonderfully written and performed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“- an engendering and gratifying listen from start to finish.\n\n01.
