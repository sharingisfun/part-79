They have done a blinding job of all sync and video work done, I have merely done a few tweaks using their source mostly to the audio and parts to video.\n\nSecond note:\n\nI know I said in my last nfo that this is it regarding encoding! This is purely for a purpose, this may be a one trip pony lol who knows. Those of who know me will see the reason behind this whilst viewing my screenshots I post :)\n\nWork done:\n\nThe first thing I have done is to remove the audio and I ran it through Goldwave and removed that constant hiss that was running the whole way through, I then remuxed it back to the original source. Now I noticed in prisM's original nfo they stated they had done alot of work to this video which is obvious to see. All I have done is I added a slight more sharpening added a bit more colour saturation, I have also played with a few colours individually i,e lowered the red and yellow. I lowered the RGB black base a touch and increased some lighting levels.\n\nRespects too:\n\nIMAGiNE, Error, prisM, Rx, all members of the Soup.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8341741fa31c27f7539ed47ae835fc4be5200401","amp;dn":"Toy.Story.3.%282010%29.TS.XviD-JamBo.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8341741fa31c27f7539ed47ae835fc4be5200401","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,65,116,31,163,28,39,247,83,158,212,122,232,53,252,75,229,32,4,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
