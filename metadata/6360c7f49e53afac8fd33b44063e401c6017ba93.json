Warren\n\nNaturopathic physician and pioneer in revolutionary healing techniques, Dr. Richard Bartlett discussed how miracles are possible, and their relationship to quantum physics and alternate universes. In 2007, he said he had a vision which showed him an energetic blockage in one of his patients. This event altered the way he looked at reality. Everyone he touched experienced some type of effect just from his contact, he detailed, and these interactions he later came to call Matrix Energetics.\n\nQuantum physics offers a possible explanation as to how his healing abilities were occurring. We're beings of light, but the problem is most people see themselves as matter, due to their perceptual biases, he said. Seeing oneself as matter creates a closed system that doesn't allow for miracles, he added. &quot;I think that miracles come from a hyperdimensional reality structure...when we set up...an adequate morphic field or quantum potential they can bleed over into our physical reality and we see things like cancers disappearing.&quot;\n\nAngels are what Tom Bearden has called &quot;virtual beings&quot; that exist in the vaccuum or zero point field and can traverse from higher dimensions into physical reality when called or activated by human consciousness, said Bartlett. The idea of infinite potential suggests that different or alternate universes are created in which every possible outcome is played out. By tapping into altered states of awareness, we can track alternate potentialities and blur the boundaries of these universes, he suggested. This could explain how tumors vanish, and paranormal activities and sightings occur, he noted.\n\nFreakiest Ghost Photos\n\nIn the last hour, paranormal investigator Joshua P. Warren talked about some of the freakiest ghost photos ever taken. The Worley House photo (see below) shows an apparition whose hairline matches that of a photo of a boy who died in the house, he said. Warren finds the photo of the 'Newby Phantom' (England 1963) to be particularly haunting. It features a Grim Reaper-like figure that looks to be between 7 and 8 feet tall. He said the photograph was examined by the British Observatory, and they found no evidence of a hoax.\n\nWebsite(s):\nmatrixenergetics.com\njoshuapwarren.com\n\nBook(s):\nThe Physics of Miracles\nMatrix Energetics: The Science and Art of Transformation\nThe Secret Wisdom of Kukulkan\n\n\n\nbrought to you by:\n                                                \n .d8888b.                                                      888    \nd88P  Y88b                                                     888    \n888    888                                                     888    \n888    888 888  888  .d88b.  888d888 .d8888b  8888b.  .d8888b  888888 \n888    888 888  888 d8P  Y8b 888P&quot;  d88P&quot;        &quot;88b 88K      888    \n888    888 Y88  88P 88888888 888    888      .d888888 &quot;Y8888b. 888    \nY88b  d88P  Y8bd8P  Y8b.     888    Y88b.    888  888      X88 Y88b.  \n &quot;Y8888P&quot;    Y88P    &quot;Y8888  888     &quot;Y8888P &quot;Y888888  88888P'  &quot;Y888 \n\nTorrents: http://thepiratebay.se/user/0vercast/\nRSS: http://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/2eb7e342dacfa8938e79732ad03e1224","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6360c7f49e53afac8fd33b44063e401c6017ba93","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+AM+-+Oct+15+2009+-+Healing%2C+Miracles%2C+%26+Alternate","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6360c7f49e53afac8fd33b44063e401c6017ba93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,96,199,244,158,83,175,172,143,211,59,68,6,62,64,28,96,23,186,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
