On the subject of US Presidents from that era and what they may have known about UFOs, Dolan revealed that a high level source told him that Jimmy Carter received a briefing on UFOs in June of 1977. According to this source, Dolan said, Carter was seen &quot;with his head in his hands and he had apparently been very, very upset about whatever he was told.&quot;\n\nDolan also spoke candidly about the challenges of covering such an era of Ufology fraught with hotly debated figures and events. &quot;In the eighteen years that this book covers, there are probably about a hundred minefields that I had to walk through to do this and none of them were topics that I really wanted to do,&quot; Dolan conceded. To that end, he stressed that his goal in profiling some of the more controversial researchers and stories was to provide insight into their role in shaping the history of UFO studies. &quot;These topics need to be handled with an even hand,&quot; Dolan contended, saying that to judge their veracity is &quot;not my obligation or even my duty.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef7c5a0e1cf91df8365e47698cc21849a2770732","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+AM+-+August+23rd+2009+-+Ufology+in+the+Cold+War+E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef7c5a0e1cf91df8365e47698cc21849a2770732","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,124,90,14,28,249,29,248,54,94,71,105,140,194,24,73,162,119,7,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
