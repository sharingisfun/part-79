Once you've seen it, you'll never get out....\nIt was a Sunday afternoon, February 23,1969, when the anthology show NBC EXPERIMENT IN TELEVISION aired a one-hour teleplay THE CUBE. It starred Richard Schaal as a man trapped in a white cubical room. He had no idea how he got there or where it was. And although anyone could enter, he couldn't leave....\nA deceptively simple teleplay, THE CUBE worked its way into the memories of many who have seen it. Metaphysical play, philosophical allegory, dark comedy, psychological drama-- THE CUBE is as hard to categorize as it is to describe.\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n************** thanks to original ripper BugZ for theatrical rips **********\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nTiTLE......
