As the crew honed in on common stylistic ground, the energy levels soared sky-high, Kirkland roaring through &quot;Man of Stone,&quot; &quot;Train Done Gone,&quot; and &quot;I Tried&quot; with ferocious fervor. ~ Bill Dahl, All Music Guide\n\nBorn in Jamaica and brought to Alabama aged two, Kirkland made his way north, initially with a medicine show, and reached Detroit at 15. He cut singles for King and various local labels, and became the best accompanist John Lee Hooker ever had. In the '60s, Kirkland returned to the South and shifted towards soul for a time, joining Otis Redding's band and having a regional hit with 'The Hawg'. Since the '70s he played blues and soul-blues for white audience.\nPrestige were bemused by 'It's The Blues Man!'; the original notes desperately suggest that it's 'perfect for Twisting'. Well, yes, if you can twist to a synthesis of industrial-strength electric guitar contortions, the vocal passion of the Pentecostal churches ('Man Of Stone' has more fire than anything Ray Charles ever did in this line) and the rhythmic force of James Brown. King Curtis and his musicians are sometimes taken a back by Kirkland's dark rawness, but they're equal to the challenge of creating a Hasting Street Saturday night in the studio. This is first solo album by Kirkland and all time, one of the his very best.\n\n\nTracklist\n1. Down On My Knees - 2:25 \n2. Don't Take My Heart - 2:28 \n3. Daddy Please Don't Cry - 3:15 \n4.
