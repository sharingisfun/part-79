The acclaimed\ndebut cd ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAllegroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ gives only a hint of the different influences the band\nhave, ranging from heavy metal, new metal and progressive to\nrock nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ roll and pop music. The band is fronted by singer Ilton Nogueira,\nwho also writes the lyrics of the songs and by guitarrist Lula Washington\nand keyboardist Bruno Sa, who are well-known for their work playing with\nother famous artists, from Brazilian pop singers to other underground acts\nas well as soundtracks for alternative movies.\nAllegro was founded in 1995 as a heavy metal band. They started\nto play all through the underground scene in Rio de Janeiro and soon\na loyal audience followed the band. The first album, released in\n2001, helped them to gather larger audiences. It was during the promotion\nof this album that they played with bands like Dr. Sin, Angra,\nStratovarius, Saxon, Shaaman, Korzus, Exodus and others. Allegro faced\nsome serious problems concerning management, record contracts\nand musical diferences that led to changes in the line up and finally\nto a break up in 2005.\n\nNow, the group started to work together once again on a new album.\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a new time for the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sound. As you can conclude from the\ndemo version of two new songs, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNo TruthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhat I Still Keep\nInsideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, the next album is going to be very diferent from the 2001 debut\nrelease. From here, Ilton and Lula expanded the sound and let other types\nof music blend with the old metal style. Although the range of influences\nare wider, the band is moving into a more song-orientated direction.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cfbbef3c6abfbd1b39cbd679d7470f8544b3582","amp;dn":"Allegro+-+S.T.+2011+power+metal+from+Brazil+like+Angra+Shaman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cfbbef3c6abfbd1b39cbd679d7470f8544b3582","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,251,190,243,198,171,251,209,179,156,189,103,157,116,112,248,84,75,53,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
