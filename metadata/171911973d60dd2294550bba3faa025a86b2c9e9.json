He was a music collector and a fan of Bob Manning, a jazz crooner in the style of Dean Martin and the like (at least to my untrained ears).\n\nAnyhow, when it arrived I found myself drawn to the image on the album cover, there was something really compelling about it, and having struck a chord I couldn't resist a listen. Although its very different to what I'd normally listen to, I have to admit it started to grow on me after a while.\n\nI've subsequently noticed on a few blogs that its quite a sought after release due to its scarcity, so I decided to upload it here for all to enjoy.
