She was primarily a country singer and songwriter, but also worked as a session guitarist in Los Angeles in the mid-50's [that is how she picked up the name, Bonnie Guitar]. She had a top ten hit on the pop charts with Dark Moon in 1957. \n\nThis is a collection of songs from CD, LP and download. Three songs came from an unfinished torrent here on TPB. A couple are encoded at a fairly low rate but still quite good.
