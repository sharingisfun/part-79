Snoop Dogg &amp; Bobby V - Girl Gotta Girlfriend [2009][GOLDFiSH_XviD]\n**********************************************************************************\n\nTaylor moved out of his home in Cricklewood, North London at age 16 on a journey of &quot;self discovery&quot; to pursue his passion for music.\n\nTaylor's debut album, Persona Non Grata, features collaborations from Joel Madden of Good Charlotte, Robbie Williams, Travis Barker, Dave Navarro, Jacoby Shaddix of Papa Roach, Yung Joc, and T-Pain. Mams Taylor has taken on odd jobs from Rose Seller to Nightclub Bouncer on his way to connecting with Hollywood royalty. Production collaborations on the album include Scott Storch, DJ Tiesto, and self-produced tracks. In the process of creating his first album, Taylor also worked with musical heavy weights such Snoop Dogg, Bobby Valentino, The Game, Lil Kim, Fat Joe, Billy Idol, and legendary producer Rodney Jerkins.\n\nTaylor is also the pioneer of the new genre of music Runk, which is the fusion of &quot;rap&quot; and &quot;punk&quot;. Taylor began experimenting with the runk sound in opposition to those who wanted to restrict his music to any one type or genre. Taylor says that runk is more than just a sound but also an attitude and way of life.\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\nVideo\n-----\nDVD Rip from the official music video 'Flo Rida Ft.
