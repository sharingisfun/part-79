The excuse is that it is an illegal use of the calculators and that it &quot;violates&quot; their copyright. This ain't gonna happen on my watch, so for anyone who wants 'em here they are.\n\nThese keys allow anyone to write an operating system that can overwrite the built in TI OS that is sent by default. Be careful because I am not liable for bricked calculators if you fail.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe01e64134fe28a16ebd2b4e20b312d3088f634d","amp;dn":"TI+OS+Keys","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe01e64134fe28a16ebd2b4e20b312d3088f634d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,1,230,65,52,254,40,161,110,189,43,78,32,179,18,211,8,143,99,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
