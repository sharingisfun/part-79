There's recently divorced Jan, who has been trying rather unsuccessfully to &quot;find herself&quot; with a trip abroad to an elephant sanctuary. But it is at home in Wadenbrook that she starts to feel happier as her friendship blossoms with ex-teacher Mary, where perhaps Jan will get to experience romance at last.\n\nThere's also driving instructor and forthright self-defence teacher Esther and her gentle and put-upon husband Jonathan who are struggling to start a family; and possibly the only happy couple in town, Ken and Keith, who are trying to teach their pet whippets to dance for the town talent night.\n\n\ncast:\nSheila Hancock\nMackenzie Crook\nPenelope Wilton\nFelicity Montagu\nKevin Eldon\nKatherine Jakeways\nRufus Wright\nSam Cotton\nJohn Biggins\n\n\nNorth By Northamptonshire - S01 - E01\nNorth By Northamptonshire - S01 - E02\nNorth By Northamptonshire - S01 - E03\nNorth By Northamptonshire - S01 - E04\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration        : 28mn 1s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2899e5dad0295e0bea6fc68e1a36f147d8562d66","amp;dn":"North+By+Northamptonshire+-+S01+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2899e5dad0295e0bea6fc68e1a36f147d8562d66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,153,229,218,208,41,94,11,234,111,198,142,26,54,241,71,216,86,45,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
