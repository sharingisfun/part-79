(2000) which confirms Gaddy's alternative calculation of the number PI as the correct method of determining this all-important mathematical constant. Dan W. Gaddy was a high school teacher of mathematics who had spent several years working out his method of squaring the circle which then showed PI to be equal to the square root of 2 plus the square root of 3. He published his results in &quot;On the Exact Measurement and Quadrature of the Circle&quot; which inspired this author to set out to prove if the method used was correct or not. Gaddy's geometric construction involves the creation of a rectangle whose sides were determined studying the &quot;nature of circular motion&quot;. The resulting Gaddy's rectangle enable us to calculate the new value for PI. Find out how the author havs come to conclude that the PI value we are using today is wrong and shows us how to correct its value. 10 pages. A must read for everyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a22465bb8e15ed9d3cd22f94b08e0e8acb6b61fb","amp;dn":"Rene-On+Squaring+Circle%28alt.+method+for+PI+value%29%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a22465bb8e15ed9d3cd22f94b08e0e8acb6b61fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,36,101,187,142,21,237,157,60,210,47,148,176,142,14,138,203,107,97,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
