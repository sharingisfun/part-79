An underground lair offers evidence of an advanced civilization. But among Altair-4ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s many wonders, none is greater or more deadly than the human mind.\n\nForbidden Planet is the granddaddy of tomorrow, a pioneering work whose ideas and style would be reverse-engineered into many cinematic space voyages to come. Leslie Nielsen plays the commander who brings his spacecruiser crew to the green-skied world thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s home to Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon), his daughter (Anne Francis)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦and to a mysterious terror. Featuring sets of extraordinary scale and the first all-electronic musical soundscape in film history, Forbidden Planet is in a movie orbit all its own.\n\nFile Type:  AVI - XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFile Size: 1.30 GB\nFile Duration: 1:38:40\nKBPS: 1692\nFPS: 23.976\nResolution: 720 x 320\nAudio: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3 -- 48000Hz  192 kb/s tot , stereo (2/0) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b7bf43a6ef4b526f547aceb70955defe1957055","amp;dn":"Forbidden+Planet+%5BDVDRip+XviD+1956%5D+%7E+Smiley.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b7bf43a6ef4b526f547aceb70955defe1957055","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,123,244,58,110,244,181,38,245,71,172,235,112,149,93,239,225,149,112,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
