In the digital era where bits &amp; bytes have the day, does anyone really \nthink about which tasks are performed by the hardware found in your typical \ncomputer? Integrated hardware components, in particular highly delicate hard \ndrives, are hard at work every day. \n\nAs long as the drive is functioning properly, you are lulled into a false sense of \nsecurity. However, when the trusted hard drive suddenly fails, this is more than \njust a minor inconvenience. The resulting loss of data is often immensely damaging.\nAshampoo HDD Control is therefore ideally suited to boost the performance of your \ndrive, guard against disk failure and remove clutter from your hard drives, while \nperforming all three functions of monitoring, maintenance and defragmentation. \n\n\nMonitoring, clean-up and defragmentation\nThe Ashampoo HDD Control software performs hard disk maintenance for you. This \ninvolves taking measures to prevent potential failures and crashes before they \noccur. Towards this end, the program combines several functions available for \nthe first time in this particular configuration. \n\nMonitoring\nThe software supports all commonly available IDE and serial ATA drives. Please \nnote, however, that devices connected to the system via USB, firewire or RAID \ncontroller often do not support this function. Based on the type of drive in use, \nAshampoo HDD Control provides the user with all important facts and information, \nincluding the firmware version, number of configured partitions, drive space and \ncurrent temperature. As the number of signs indicating that the drive could soon \npotentially fail begins to mount, the background guard signals an alarm. If you \nare not near your computer, the program can be set up to notify you of the alert \nby email. In the final report, the program also provides information on the health\nand performance of the hard drive shown in percentages. \n\nMaintenance\nOver time, an ever-growing number of unwanted and unneeded files accumulate on \nyour hard drive and Ashampoo HDD Control is a useful tool to help you locate and \ndelete these files. Temporary files, files in the recycling bin and backup copies \nare all removed. In addition, the software empties the cache, clears the browsing \nhistory and erases cookies from the Internet browser. \n\nDefragmentation\nAn empty space appears when you delete a file from your hard drive. This gap is \nthen filled the next time a file is saved to disk. If not enough space is \navailable to store the complete file in this space, it's broken up into fragments. \nWindows in turn saves these at different locations on the hard drive in order to \nmake best use of the available gaps. For this reason, it is easy to understand why \nthe computer takes longer to read the file, since it first of all needs to locate \nand assemble all the separate fragments. With its defragmentation module, Ashampoo \nHDD Control is able to read out file fragments and arrange these in one cluster on \nthe hard drive to ensure rapid access. As a result, the hard drive needs to spin \nless while the performance remains unchanged. As an additional benefit, there is \nless demand placed on system resources. \n\nProactive defragmentation uses the time when you are not working to measure the \nlevel of disk fragmentation. If it needs to be defragmented, the process is \nstarted automatically. \n\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Background guard continuously monitors status, performance and temperature\n* In-depth explanations and information on context-sensitive help\n* Displays all current SMART files with detailed explanations\n* Able to export reports for support purposes\n* Powerful, high-speed disk clean-up\n* Objects found can be configured and managed in shortcut menus\n* Objects found can be managed using intelligent filter mechanisms\n* New exception rules can be created manually or automatically\n* High-quality defragmentation performed to latest standards\n* Fully automatic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“proactiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ defragmentation runs in background\n* Defragmentation algorithm with minimum impact on system performance\n* Self-monitoring, analysis, status reports on imminent failures\n\n\nAll functions at a glance \n\nBasic functions\n- Background guard continuously monitors status, performance and temperature \n- In-depth explanations and information on context-sensitive help \n- Displays all current SMART files with detailed explanations \n- Able to export reports for support purposes \n- Fully configurable temperature monitoring available in Celsius and Fahrenheit \n- Option to automatically save all incidents in separate log \n- Simple controls and GUI including color schemes \n- Easy and automatic software updates \n\nCleanup\n- Powerful, high-speed disk clean-up \n- Objects found can be configured and managed in shortcut menus \n- Objects found can be managed using intelligent filter mechanisms \n- New exception rules can be created manually or automatically \n- Supports the latest generation of browsers (Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera) \n- Wide range of options to customize configuration to meet user requirements \n- High level of security thanks to years of experience and advanced cookie \n  management \n\nDefragmentation\n- High-quality defragmentation performed to latest standards \n- Fully automatic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“proactiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ defragmentation runs in background \n- Defragmentation algorithm with minimum impact on system performance \n- Range of defragmentation options (fast, normal, intelligent) \n- Parallel defragmentation of all drives and/or partitions \n- Comprehensive configuration and customization options \n\nMonitoring\n- Self-monitoring, analysis, status reports on imminent failures \n- Evaluation of health and performance status of your hard drive(s) \n- Range of evaluation criteria available for customized configuration \n- S.M.A.R.T. technology provides information on (if supported by drive): \n  Number of hours in operation and start-up processes \n  * Error rate during positioning \n  * Start/stop processes of drive heads \n  * Number of parking sequences for write/read units \n  * Disk calibration attempts \n  * Reallocations (in event of bad disk sectors) \n  * Controller &lt;-&gt; hard drive transfer rate (defective cable) \n  * And many more \n- Temperature display including early warning of overheating \n- Email alerts to notify user that condition of hard drive(s) \n  has deteriorated and failure is imminent \n- Direct link to Windows event log \n\nBenchmark\n- Identifies all values required to evaluate the performance of your hard drive(s) \n- Clearly structured GUI for performance evaluation (benchmark) \n- Online database link for direct comparison of your results with other systems \n  Clear presentation of information and values on: \n  * min./max. data transfer rates \n  * average data transfer rates \n  * access times \n\n\n\nSystem Requirements: Windows XP, Vista (32/64), Windows 7\n\n\n\nMore info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ashampoo.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ashampoo.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www2.ashampoo.com/webcache/html/1/product_2_0065___EUR.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www2.ashampoo.com/webcache/html/1/product_2_0065___EUR.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;When using TPB please read these important notes: \n****************************************************\n\n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of \n    their capabilities (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not trusting \n    keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting antimalware-apps sending scanning-results to their companies can coz\n    keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n06- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n10- Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting &quot;TPB's Most Ridiculous Comments&quot;:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my account*:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n*All torrents scanned with:\n1- Norton Internet Security  \n2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  \n3- AVG Antivirus Pro   \n4- Kaspersky AV Pro  \n5- NOD32 AV  \n\n...and also with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected by \n   other anti-malware apps probably are false positives!\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of PB members abuse their PB membership by intenionally posting \nfake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to \nfrustrate PB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less \ndownloadspeed etc etc. \n\nIt's in the benefit of PB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and PB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\n                                         \n* Status torrent at sept, 14 2009 - 23.05 CET: clean, tested &amp; working.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46224614b0a92ff79d32a3adf72c95703cf01040","amp;dn":"Ashampoo+HDD+Control+v1.10+%2B+Keys+%5BRH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46224614b0a92ff79d32a3adf72c95703cf01040","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,34,70,20,176,169,47,247,157,50,163,173,247,44,149,112,60,240,16,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
