It took me about seven and a half hours to make. I didn't add any new units, but I did add about 100 new countries. I especially added a lot of countries in Africa, the Middle East, Oceania, and the Caribbean that you can liberate. I've also made a couple of balance changes, added new cities, and fixed some historical inaccuracies. I really did a lot of research on the countries I've added, and tried to be as historically accurate as possible. I have tested this scenario myself and it works fine. This scenario requires the full non-Gold version of Making History: The Calm and the Storm with the latest patch (which you can get here: http://making-history.com/files/MHPatch204.exe ) to play. The download is 522 KB and may take a couple of minutes to download for dial-up users.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d13acf01bc3fe587c4c851616b6edba80e053b92","amp;dn":"War+of+the+World+-+Making+History+scenario","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d13acf01bc3fe587c4c851616b6edba80e053b92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,58,207,1,188,63,229,135,196,200,81,97,107,110,219,168,14,5,59,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
