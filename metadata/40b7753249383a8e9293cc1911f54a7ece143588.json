He agrees to participate in the charade, but with a few conditions of his own. The unlikely couple heads to Alaska to meet his quirky family and the always-in-control city girl finds herself in one comedic fish-out-of-water situation after another. With an impromptu wedding in the works and an immigration official on their tails, Margaret and Andrew reluctantly vow to stick to the plan despite the precarious consequences.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1041829/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1041829/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40b7753249383a8e9293cc1911f54a7ece143588","amp;dn":"The.Proposal.DVDRip.XviD-JUMANJi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40b7753249383a8e9293cc1911f54a7ece143588","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,183,117,50,73,56,58,142,146,147,204,25,17,245,74,126,206,20,53,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
