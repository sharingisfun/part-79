Pocket Sailor is an add on to the Navigator system and allows charts and routes to be downloaded on to a palm top PC. This is the ideal solution for smaller boats where it is not practical to carry a laptop or as a second mobile unit on a larger yacht.\n\nPocket Sailor has functions that are available within NaviGator, such as Ahead, ERBL, MOB, GOTO, Dead Reckoning and Info.\n\nAlong with these, some new functions have been added: GPS Monitoring, GPS detection option, GPS On / Off and an Undo Button.\n\nThe Undo feature remembers what you have done in Pocket Sailor, from zooming in, to moving around the charts, and allows a user to go back if a mistake has been made.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3c35c79afe132cc9f84304278f43dfe3e5c3594","amp;dn":"Pocket+Sailor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3c35c79afe132cc9f84304278f43dfe3e5c3594","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,195,92,121,175,225,50,204,159,132,48,66,120,244,61,254,62,92,53,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
