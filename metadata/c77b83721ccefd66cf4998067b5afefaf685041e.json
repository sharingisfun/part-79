This is a much better copy.\nHowever, there are problems with this one, and I cannot fix them.\nWith the other two swashbuckler videos I recently uploaded I was able to bring them down to a smaller size and adjust the subtitles to fit. This one I cannot.\n\nMy 84-year-old brain is not up to the task. So rather than wasting my time and yours I'll send it as-is. It's big, but it's beautiful compared to my original.\n\nNever mind the German influence, if you just want to watch it without subtitles, and if you have the hard drive space, enjoy.\n\nIf you figure out how to do what I cannot do, let me know.\n\n\nJohn Gordon\njgordon20904\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;95fff2fae7f1fafba7a5aca5a1d5f6faf8f6f4e6e1bbfbf0e1&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c77b83721ccefd66cf4998067b5afefaf685041e","amp;dn":"The+Man+in+the+Iron+Mask+2+update+%281977%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c77b83721ccefd66cf4998067b5afefaf685041e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,123,131,114,28,206,253,102,207,73,152,6,123,90,254,250,246,133,4,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
