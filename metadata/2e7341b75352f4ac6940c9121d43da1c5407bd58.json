In the first, the author focuses on what is called &quot;The Body Temple,&quot; detailing the relationship between humanity and God in areas such as spiritual growth, who God is, and having a right perception of Him.\n\nThe second half of the book deals with &quot;The Spirit Temple&quot; and is a group guide expounding on principles necessary to any successful relationship, such as honesty, practical communication, preference versus conviction, and more. Each chapter has a list of questions and exercises for either the individual or the group to perform, depending on in which setting the book is used.
