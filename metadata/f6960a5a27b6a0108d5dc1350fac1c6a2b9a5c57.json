Host Ian Boyne invited David Mould, a 7th Day Adventist lay activist, and Peter Espeut, a Roman Catholic Deacon, to each present his view on what exactly was the role of Rome in that fateful day that Lincoln died. Mould uses undisputable historical documents and books to present a solid case of a jesuitical plot that involved dozens of people, had other political figures as targets as well, but eventually managed to murder only the president. On the other side Espeut demonstrates shear ignorance of the events and attempts to redirect the conversation to unimportant topics. Find out how history successfully recorded who was behind that fateful event and how we are today virtually ignorant of what really happened. 50 min. long. A must see for everyone.\n\nVideo specs:\nVideo codec: xvid, 720x480, 1200 kbps\nAudio codec: MP3, 48kHz, Stereo\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6960a5a27b6a0108d5dc1350fac1c6a2b9a5c57","amp;dn":"Lincoln+Assassination%28Jesuit+plot+to+assassinate+Abraham+Lincoln","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6960a5a27b6a0108d5dc1350fac1c6a2b9a5c57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,150,10,90,39,182,160,16,141,93,193,53,15,172,28,106,43,154,92,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
