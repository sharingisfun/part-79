It began in 1977 as a conventional motoring magazine show. Over time, and especially since a relaunch in 2002, it has developed a quirky, humorous style. The show is currently presented by Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, and also features a test driver known as The Stig. The programme is estimated to have 350 million viewers worldwide.\n\nGenre \tMotoring Action\n\nPresented by \tJeremy Clarkson\n                Richard Hammond\n                James May\n                The Stig (White)\n                Jason Dawe\n                The Stig (Black)\n\nOpening theme \t&quot;Jessica&quot;\n\nComposer(s) \tDickey Betts\n\nCountry of origin \tUnited Kingdom\n\nLanguage(s) \tEnglish\n\nNo. of series \t15\n\nNo. of episodes \t117 and 6 specials\n\nRunning time \t60 min\n\n       ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0b8d4b89b193c6e3bf2c9fc692f4062909681f3","amp;dn":"Top_Gear_13_Seasons_%2B_Extra-TiGORiN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0b8d4b89b193c6e3bf2c9fc692f4062909681f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,184,212,184,155,25,60,110,59,242,201,252,105,47,64,98,144,150,129,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
