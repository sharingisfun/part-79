And at every stage along the way, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s imbued all of his music with deep passion, a uniquely creative spirit, and more than a little bit of sly humor.\n\nBorn and raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Elvin Bishop didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have much exposure to live music as a youngster.But his family had a radio, and in between the pop schmaltz and the C&amp;W that ruled the airwaves in the 1950s, that radio could sometimes catch the legendary R&amp;B programming beamed throughout the southern part of the U.S. at night by Nashville radio station WLAC. That station introduced Bishop to the classic records of Jimmy Reed, HowlinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Wolf and Muddy Waters, and once his ears had been hooked, there was no turning back for young Elvin. He soon got his first guitar and on his own began scratching out the basic outlines of the blues, R&amp;B and rock &amp; roll that had captured his imagination.\n\n\nZDaddyÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® says: &quot;Sharing is Caring!&quot; Please seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7f7bd91ff5d93085fa1f9289eb72a9685236a29","amp;dn":"Elvin+Bishop+-+Red+Dog+Speaks+%282010%29+%5B+Blues%2FRock+%5D+-+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7f7bd91ff5d93085fa1f9289eb72a9685236a29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,247,189,145,255,93,147,8,95,161,249,40,158,183,42,150,133,35,106,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
