Jet Bradley, son of original TRON programmer Alan Bradley, has recently escaped the computer world. But his experiences within cyberspace have left him emotionally scarred - vivid nightmares plague him, and he's become paranoid and unstable. He shuns technology wherever possible, leaving him effectively crippled in the modern world. And now something within the computer world wants him back!\n\nThe comic book is written by Landry Walker and Eric Jones, with art in the first two issues by Louie De Martinis.  The comic from Slave Labor Graphics opens with a detailed history of the Tron universe, providing previously unknown background on the events that allowed Ed Dillinger and the MCP to rise to power.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b5e8f67ccaeac7e8646c5c540510b23d0a77a54","amp;dn":"Tron+%28SLG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b5e8f67ccaeac7e8646c5c540510b23d0a77a54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,94,143,103,204,174,172,126,134,70,197,197,64,81,11,35,208,167,122,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
