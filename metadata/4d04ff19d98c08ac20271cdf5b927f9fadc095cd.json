It reached #3 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe basic melody line for &quot;The Best of Times&quot; is used in two other places on the album: As a bold greeting to the listener in &quot;A.D. 1928&quot;, and a softer, more subdued version for the farewell track, &quot;A.D. 1958&quot;.\n\nParadise Theatre is a concept album released by the rock band Styx in January 1981.\n\nThe album, a fictional account of Chicago's Paradise Theater from its opening to closing (and eventual abandonment), is used as a metaphor for America's changing times from the late 1970s into the 1980s (group leader Dennis DeYoung confirmed this on an episode of In the Studio with Redbeard which devoted an entire episode to the making of the album).\n\nThe signature song, &quot;The Best of Times&quot; (written by group leader Dennis DeYoung), went all the way to #3 and &quot;Too Much Time on My Hands&quot; written by Tommy Shaw went to #9 on the Billboard hot 100, and (and was Shaw's only top 10 hit for Styx). Rockin' The Paradise went to #1 on the Top Rock Track Chart.\n\nThe song &quot;Snowblind&quot; (lyrics by James Young, music by Young as DeYoung) was an attack on drug addiction. The track would come under fire for supposedly having backward messages and be branded by reactionary fundamentalists and Tipper Gore's PMRC as &quot;Satanistic.&quot; JY and DeYoung refuted this on the In the Studio episode. Other impartial sources have also said that the claim of Satanic messages on this record as being completely false.\n\nParadise Theatre became Styx's first, and to date only US #1 album, as well the band's fourth consecutive triple-platinum album.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d04ff19d98c08ac20271cdf5b927f9fadc095cd","amp;dn":"Styx+-+The+Best+Of+Times++%28Xvid-2nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d04ff19d98c08ac20271cdf5b927f9fadc095cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,4,255,25,217,140,8,172,32,39,28,223,91,146,127,159,173,192,149,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
