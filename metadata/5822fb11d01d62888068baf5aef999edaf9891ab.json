The third album Somewhere Over The Radio saw a greater emphasis on their distinctive brand of jangly pop/rock spawning two singles &quot;Run Baby Run&quot; and &quot;Deeper Water&quot; (their biggest hit, reaching #28 on the Australian ARIAnet Singles Chart[1]) bringing the band some success in Australia in 1999.\n\nThe band enjoyed mixed success during its lifetime. Always Triple J favourites and in later days finding themselves on high rotation on the commercial radio stations.\n\n--Track Listing--\n01 Run Baby Run\n02 Deeper Water\n03 Lights Go Down\n04 Drivin'\n05 Highway 31\n06 Satellite\n07 Texas\n08 Here You Come\n09 Over The Radio\n10 Don't Leave\n11 Salon Baby\n12 Not For Money","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5822fb11d01d62888068baf5aef999edaf9891ab","amp;dn":"Deadstar+-+Somewhere+Over+The+Radio%2C+1999+%28320kbs+MP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5822fb11d01d62888068baf5aef999edaf9891ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,34,251,17,208,29,98,136,128,104,186,245,174,249,153,237,175,152,145,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
