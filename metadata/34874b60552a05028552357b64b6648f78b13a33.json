Set in New York State, the story centres on juvenile murderer, Eric Poole, who at 18 is released from jail having served his sentence for the murder of a young girl. Russell Crowe play the hard-bitten detective who put him away and who is sure Poole is a potential serial killer who will reoffend. He makes it his mission to keep Poole under surveillance as he sets off on a seemingly innocent road trip up-state. But all is not as it seems as Poole soon finds himself on the run with a young girl who has become obsessed with him.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0494864/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0494864/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34874b60552a05028552357b64b6648f78b13a33","amp;dn":"Tenderness.LIMITED.DVDRip.XviD-SAPHiRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34874b60552a05028552357b64b6648f78b13a33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,135,75,96,85,42,5,2,133,82,53,123,100,182,100,143,120,177,58,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
