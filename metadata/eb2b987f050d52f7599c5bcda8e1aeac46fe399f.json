Sure, it transfers files at donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t-blink-or-youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll-miss-it speeds, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also a complete Web design toolbox. Use it to make lastÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½minute edits, preview and organize your files, and back everything up, just in case. It's the only FTP client with a full-blown, built-in Web editor that lets you work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and more. With other stellar features like bookmarks, easy archival, and a neatly ordered activity log, it leads the pack in power and usability.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.CoffeeCup.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.CoffeeCup.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.NerdyJustin.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.NerdyJustin.com&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb2b987f050d52f7599c5bcda8e1aeac46fe399f","amp;dn":"CoffeeCup+Direct+FTP+6.2+%5BRETAIL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb2b987f050d52f7599c5bcda8e1aeac46fe399f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,43,152,127,5,13,82,247,89,156,91,205,168,225,174,172,70,254,57,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
