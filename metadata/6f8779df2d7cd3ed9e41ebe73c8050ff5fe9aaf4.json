Though Traffic disbanded in 1974, Winwood and Capaldi reunited 20 years later for the 1994 album FAR FROM HOME and a corresponding U.S. tour that took them from New York to Los Angeles and many points in between--including a stop at the historic Woodstock '94. THE LAST GREAT TRAFFIC JAM assembles that reunion tour's never-before-seen footage into a remarkable concert film that combines candid backstage interviews with rare live performances of hits like &quot;Low Spark,&quot; &quot;Glad,&quot; &quot;John Barleycorn,&quot; and a once-in-a-lifetime rendition of &quot;Dear Mr. Fantasy&quot; featuring guest guitarist Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead.\n\n# Actors: Traffic\n# Directors: *\n# Format: Closed-captioned, Color, DVD, Enhanced, NTSC\n# Language: English\n# Region: Region 1 \n# Number of discs: 1\n# Rated: NR (Not Rated)\n# Studio: Sony\n# DVD Release Date: September 20, 2005\n# Run Time: 100 minutes\n\nTRACK LISTING\n\n1 Introduction\n2 Pearly Queen\n3 Medicated Goo\n4 Mozambique\n5 40,000 Headmen\n6 Glad\n7 Walking in the Wind\n8 The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys\n9 Light Up or Leave Me Alone\n10 Dear Mr. Fantasy\n11 John Barleycorn (Must Die)\n12 Gimme Some Lovin'\n\n\nEnjoy the show, and don't be shy about leaving comments!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f8779df2d7cd3ed9e41ebe73c8050ff5fe9aaf4","amp;dn":"Traffic+-+The+Last+Great+Traffic+Jam+-+cOOt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f8779df2d7cd3ed9e41ebe73c8050ff5fe9aaf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,135,121,223,45,124,211,237,158,65,235,231,60,128,80,255,95,233,170,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
