It is about a priest who begins to doubt his faith, and then ends up taking the place of the Antichrist. &quot;There's this dude that works as a priest's assistant, and after a while he just discovers that he has nothing to do with Christianity,&quot; Silenoz says. &quot;He just sort of has this awakening and realizes that he has different abilities and different powers and is leaning more to the dark side.&quot; The words &quot;In Sorte Diaboli&quot; are a repeated line in the song &quot;The Chosen Legacy&quot; and the words also appears towards the end of the song, &quot;The Sinister Awakening&quot;. The conclusion of the story in the booklet implies that the story of In Sorte Diaboli is not yet finished, possibly hinting that Dimmu Borgir's next studio album will continue this concept. Additionally, the &quot;Making of In Sorte Diaboli&quot; Special feature, Silenoz says that the concept of this album will continue into the next five albums, finishing a six part series. IGN named the album the Top Metal Album of 2007.\n\n\n\n\n1 - The Serpentine Offering 05:11\n2 - The Chosen Legacy 04:19\n3 - The Conspiracy Unfolds 05:25\n4 - The Sacrilegious Scorn 04:02\n5 - The Fallen Arises 03:01\n6 - The Heretic Hammer [Bonus] 04:39\n7 - The Sinister Awakening 05:12\n8 - The Fundamental Alienation 05:19\n9 - The Invaluable Darkness 04:46\n10 - The Foreshadowing Furnace 05:49 \n\n\nShagrath Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals\nSilenoz Ã¢â‚¬â€œ rhythm guitar, liner story\nGalder Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead guitar\nMustis Ã¢â‚¬â€œ synthesizers\nI.C.S.
