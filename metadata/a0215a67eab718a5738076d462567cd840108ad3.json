House Mix XIII - A Half Life Mix (VIII-VII-MMX)\n\nBrought to you by www d0t musicthroughscience d0t com\n\n\n\nWelcome back friends.  You're just in time for the release of my latest and greatest house mix.  Had a blast throwing this one together as I've been trying new techniques and software for my final productions.  If you are curious about the Half Life theme it was actually suggested to me by a friend and I couldn't resist trying it out.  It adds a bit of life to the mixes which is why I always have some sort of theme going on.  Some amazing effects and sound bytes mixed in from one of the greatest games of all time......Half Life.\n\nThere are some serious tracks to check out so don't miss them.  Personal favourite has to be the new Pryda track &quot;M.S.B.O.Y&quot;.  It's fucking brilliant.  A close second is the new track by Cirez D called &quot;The Tumble&quot; which starts things off with a bang.   \n\nAs always these are the latest and greatest house tracks from around the world all perfectly mixed just for you.  They're only getting better so stay tuned and be ready to move with this one.  Thanks again for all the support, feedback, emails and comments! Remember to check out my facebook fan page and come back here for updates, pics, and great house music.  If you like what you hear I ask you to please pass it on to your mates.  All of this is done from the heart for house music lovers around the world.  Pay it forward as they say.....take care my friends.\n\nKeep smiling, keep dancing......\n\n\nna.K.\n\n(Visit www d0t musicthroughscience d0t com to download all my House mixes)\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\nIntro - This is Where I Get Off........\nCirez D - The Tumble (Original Mix)\nCriminal Vibes - Bring the Beat (Original Mix)\nStefano Noferini - Burujava (Original Vibes Mix)\nPatrick M - You Got (Original Mix)\nFM Radio Gods - 333 (D-Nox &amp; Beckers Remix)\nJoris Voorn - The Secret (Original Mix) \nPryda - M.S.B.O.Y.
