Since\n2001, Dimitris Violitzis and Elias Garanis from\nGreece have constantly developed their very own\ndefinition of Power Progressive Trance\n\nThe epic flow of their music is inspired by their\nmusical background, which includes minimal\nProgressive Trance on the one hand but also\nclassical and Celtic music, New Age sounds and\neven some Metal\n\nThe intense effectiveness of Krama's tunes could\nalready been witnessed on many different\nProgressive floors where the two dudes always\ndelivered excellent shows\n\nlink:\n\nTracks\n\n# track length\n\n01 Rain (Prelude) 02:50\n02 After The Rain 08:39\n03 Ex Animo 07:28\n04 Antiverse 07:00\n05 Basilisk 07:59\n06 Rise on 07:46\n07 Tribes of Whispers 07:05\n08 For All These Reasons 08:05\n09 Spin Spirit 06:47\n10 Girl Needs 07:29\n\nNews\n\nCurrently groovmission is searching for:\ndedicated ripper / supplier with fast access\nto fresh &amp; unreleased quality electronic music\n(CDs, Vinyls, Promos, DigitalDownloads, Livesets)\ncollectors of old&amp;rare stuff who are interested\nto digitize their collection for infinity\naffil sites with multi sections (100mbit+/4tb+)\nWanna be part of the legend?
