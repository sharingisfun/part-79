V6/A10\n\nHelp me seed (to a ratio of at least 2.0) &amp; get these 'out there' - I have a max. upload speed of c. 80k/s.\n\nThe more help I get the quicker everyone gets them.\n\nIt's a team effort. Please do your part.\n\nUntil I see enough seeding of previous episodes, I won't be allowing anyone to get 100% of the rest of this season, nor uploading seasons 4 - 10. No apologies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0369bb71b6d9c6979433f1b7b7988df4b996f00","amp;dn":"Scrapheap+Challenge+-+03x08+-+Giant+Mower.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0369bb71b6d9c6979433f1b7b7988df4b996f00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,54,155,183,27,109,156,105,121,67,63,27,123,121,136,223,75,153,111,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
