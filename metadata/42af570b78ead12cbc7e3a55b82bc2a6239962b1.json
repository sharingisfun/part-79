Now, in her magnificent work of storytelling and imagination Margaret George bring us Henry VIII's story as he himself might have told it, in memoirs interspersed with irreverent comments from his jester and confident, Will Somers. Brilliantly combining history, wit, dramatic narrative, and an extraordinary grasp of the pleasures and perils of power, this monumental novel shows us Henry the man more vividly than he has ever been seen before.\n\n\nAn extraordinary novel that brings into vivid focus the larger-than-life King Henry VIII, monarch of prodigious appetites for wine, women, and song. This is a readable, entertaining, tour de force that captures the essence of the Sixteenth Century, in all its drama and atmosphere. A can't-miss for readers who delight in wonderful historical fiction perfectly rendered.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42af570b78ead12cbc7e3a55b82bc2a6239962b1","amp;dn":"The+Autobiography+of+Henry+VIII++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42af570b78ead12cbc7e3a55b82bc2a6239962b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,175,87,11,120,234,209,44,188,126,58,85,184,43,194,166,35,153,98,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
