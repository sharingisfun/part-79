Goal was &quot;preview&quot; quality, not the ultimate one - what is self-evident from redicolously small file-size. Trade-offs must be included.\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).\nFor example; when I finish encoding, I always check out the file, do short preview, rewinding back and forth. It usualy looks ugly - but - then I move back and sit on the sofa, 6 feet away - and everything looks as it should. Nice and watchable, like on older, analog TV set.\n\nWARNING: \n                     a) If you are from developed countries, have download \n                     speed above 15 KB/s, think twice what are you doing.\n                     b) If you download [quark] to test your &quot;equipment&quot; \n                     forget about it, on first sign of &quot;malfunctioning&quot;\n                     or &quot;misdoings&quot; of any kind I will block you. (if you \n                     change IP number, I will block your ISP, your region, \n                     your country and even whole continent. \n                     So, think thrice what are you doing. \n                     Internet IS Big place and you can go anywhere else, true? \n                     No one force you to download my torrents, right?\n                     c) If you have FAST connection, HELP the people by downloading\n                      - however NOT as you've done elsewhere, but by KEEPING your \n                     UPLOAD SPEED at MAX. Any other behavior will be treated\n                     appropriately.\n                     d) When you finished downloading [quark] STAY TO SEED. \n                     Anyone who can download - CAN UPLOAD too.\n                     Ones who cannot - only because they are poor - are excluded.\n                     Ones who are not poor, I beg you to show two things: \n                     solidarity and perpetual goodness.\n                     \n                     \nPLEASE, think about the ones who have Internet but cannot afford download of big files.\nEvery day I have 10% of my peers on dial-up and ancient hardware who need whole day to download a &quot;normal&quot; sized 350MB.\nPlease, I beg you for understanding of my work, let them through and if you can - help them by downloading and seeding afterward as long as you can. These people have slow download and it helps them a lot (please, be generous - on such file having ratio 10.7:1 is like 1:1 on normal-sized XviD).. \nExample for the ones looking more on ratio numbers, than real and &quot;generated&quot; traffic (ones who need to save - skip this, its just an example):\n&gt;&gt;XviD's downloading 350MB: giving back 350MB equals 700MB (1:1 ratio)\n&gt;&gt;[quark]'s is ~60MB + 11 times 60 = 660 MB equals 720MB (well... 20 MB &quot;more&quot;)\nSo, people who can give more, should not be focused on plain ratio-number too much - in &quot;world&quot; of [quarks] many things are different.\n\nThank you.\n\n******************************EXAMPLE*************************************\n\n&gt; ....... at 2010-04-15 22:59 CET: \n\nthanks, i'll be seeding for the rest of the day, but my upload speed sucks and won't make a big difference.\n\n&gt;....... at 2010-04-16 06:09 CET: \nP.S. I am having a problem understanding 'RATIOS'in relation to seeding.\n        I use uTorrent 2.x and it uses percentages for ratio of seeding.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;twentyforty at 2010-04-16 06:56 CET: \n\nRatios are irrelevant guys. They are &quot;numbers&quot; that mean something just - to you.\nIf someone pays, pays by the traffic (megabytes, gigabytes) not by the ratio, right?\n\nThe point I was trying to make was just: If you want... and can - seed - do not look at the ratio. \nFile is mostly in range 20 - 70 MB.\nTo seed few FILES back to the people, doesn't look too costly. And it doesn't looks complicated to understand too\n\nUnfortunately, that's why [quark] torrent dies within 6 hours. Many little hands together can move the mountain. For instance, most downloaded [quark] is &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot; - 1147 times. Could you imagine that ALL people stayed to seed - at 1kB/s? Just that. At least for a while. I do understand the problem of daily nature of the daily talk shows pack (shelf-life is built-in), but - for sake of god - not to stay on two-three seeders within few hours.\n\n**************** MANY LITTLE HANDS TOGETHER CAN MOVE THE MOUNTAIN ***************\n\n\nFormat               : MPEG-4\nFormat/Info          : ISO 14496-1 Base Media\nFormat/Family        : MPEG-4\nFile size            : 120 MiB\nPlayTime             : 1h 29mn\nBit rate             : 187 Kbps\nStreamSize           : 848 KiB\nEncoded date         : UTC 2010-04-17 09:46:02\nTagged date          : UTC 2010-04-17 09:46:02\n\nVideo #0\nCodec                : H.264\nCodec/Info           : H.264 (3GPP)\nPlayTime             : 1h 29mn\nBit rate             : 170 Kbps\nWidth                : 352 pixels\nHeight               : 192 pixels\nDisplay Aspect ratio : 16/9\nFrame rate           : 25.000 fps\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)   : 0.098\n\nAudio #0\nCodec                : AAC LC-SBR-PS\nCodec/Info           : AAC Low Complexity with Spectral Band Replication and Parametric Stereo\nPlayTime             : 1h 29mn\nBit rate             : 16 Kbps\nBit rate mode        : VBR\nChannel(s)           : 2 channels\nSampling rate        : 22 KHz\nResolution           : 16 bits\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:769a3c7dc2a75dc9ad41bd9471eb9a37fd9e7572","amp;dn":"The.Crazies.2010.R5.LiNE.H264%5Bquark%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"769a3c7dc2a75dc9ad41bd9471eb9a37fd9e7572","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,154,60,125,194,167,93,201,173,65,189,148,113,235,154,55,253,158,117,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
