In what is now the North Sea and the English Channel, there was an area of land the size of England itself ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a great plain that stretched across from the east of Britain to what is now Denmark, northern Germany, Holland, Belgium and France. Meandering through it, the rivers Rhine, Thames and Seine and their various tributaries converged into an immense estuary that discharged into the Atlantic Ocean to the west. \n\nAs temperatures rose and the ice melted, the land joining Britain to the continent became home to great grasslands, forests, marshes and lakes. It was populated by a wide variety of animals, birds, fish ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and humans. For a time 'Doggerland', as it has been dubbed, possessed rich natural resources that would have drawn people northwards from the European mainland. For a couple of thousand years, perhaps, before it began to be swamped by meltwaters from the end of the Ice Age, it would have been a mini-paradise for the Mesolithic hunter-gatherers who dwelt there. \n\nThen, in a relatively short period of time ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ fast enough for its effects to have been observed by the people living there ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a very rapid rise in sea levels transformed the landscape utterly. The world those Mesolithic hunter-gatherers knew quite literally disappeared beneath the waves. By about 6,000 years ago, it had gone entirely. Britain was no longer part of Europe but an island, and its development began to diverge from that of the continent from which its latest wave of human occupants had arrived. \n\nIn this Time Team Special, Tony Robinson and the Team call upon the leading experts in the field to piece together the new discoveries and research that have rewritten the books on the ancient human occupation of Britain in recent years. It is a fascinating tale of the drowned world that once was part of Britain. \n\n\nAncient human occupation of Britain.\nThe earliest humans. \nIn 2001, ex-policeman and amateur archaeologist Mike Chambers made a discovery that would help push back the earliest known date for human activity in Britain by several hundred thousand years. For sticking out of the seabed off the Norfolk coast at Happisburgh he found a hand axe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ one of the earliest artefacts made by humans ever discovered in northern Europe. \n\nLocated in the remains of an ancient forest, revealed only at low tide, the axe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ like the forest ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ was dated to between 500,000 and 700,000 years ago. It was one of several key discoveries made very recently that have stunned archaeologists and other scientists studying the ancient human occupation of Britain, and transformed our understanding of the earliest human activity here in the space of less than a decade. \n\nMike Chambers' find coincided with the establishment of a large-scale research project, the Ancient Human Occupation of Britain (AHOB), bringing together archaeologists and scientists from a range of different disciplines and organisations to investigate this neglected period of prehistory. As one of the scientists involved in the project remarked, in relation to mapping the lost land bridge between Britain and Europe, so crucial to our understanding of early human activity here, 'We know more about the surface of Mars than we do this.' \n\nSpectacular findings. \nAHOB's work resulted in spectacular findings. As well as the Happisburgh site, where they found a second hand axe in 2004, a team of experts assembled by AHOB also investigated another site in East Anglia at Pakefield. This, too, had first been highlighted by amateurs, who had discovered what appeared to be a tiny fragment of worked flint in situ in the same beds as a large collection of animal bones. \n\nOver the course of the next few years, AHOB's excavations turned up more than 30 such flint flakes and one flint core from four different contexts at Pakefield. This suggested that humans were regular visitors to a landscape that experts had previously believed to have been devoid of human activity. \n\nThe Pakefield flints were found in sediments that contained large quantities of microscopic mammal bones. It was these that enabled scientists to date the flints. In particular, AHOB used what is often referred to by scientists as the 'vole clock', which featured in a previous Time Team programme at Elveden in the 2000 series. Simon Parfitt identified a species of Mimomys vole among the Pakefield sediments. This is known to have died out in European Russia before MIS16, an extremely severe cold period, and together with other mammal deposits enabled AHOB to date the flint finds to around 700,000 years ago. \n\nHeadline news. \nSince the oldest previous known evidence for a human presence in Britain dated from less than 500,000 years ago, this was a dramatic discovery ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and it made headline news when it was first reported, in an article in Nature, at the end of 2005. Many of those reports referred to the people who made these tiny tools as the 'earliest Britons', although actually there is no direct line of descent between them and the people who inhabit these islands today. \n\nIn fact, as Chris Stringer explains in Britain's drowned world, there have been eight separate waves of colonisation of what is now Britain, seven of which have failed. These have coincided with the warmer periods between Ice Ages, with humans moving into Britain as the ice sheets retreated and being forced out again as they expanded. The latest (and, so far, uninterrupted) wave of occupation dates only from when temperatures began to rise again with the ending of the most recent Ice Age, starting about 13,000 years ago. \n\nwow - if you read all that - Well done :P\n\nVidep info:-\n\nComplete name                : Time Team Special - Britains Drowned World (5th May 2008 [Xvid (PDTV)].SM Staff Approved Proper.avi\nFormat                       : AVI\nFormat/Info                  : Audio Video Interleave\nFormat/Family                : RIFF\nFile size                    : 600 MiB\nPlayTime                     : 1h 17mn\nBit rate                     : 1086 Kbps\nStreamSize                   : 4.04 MiB\nWriting application          : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nWriting library              : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\nVideo #0\nCodec                        : XviD\nCodec/Family                 : MPEG-4V\nCodec/Info                   : XviD project\nCodec profile                : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\nCodec settings, Packet bitst : No\nCodec settings, BVOP         : Yes\nCodec settings, QPel         : No\nCodec settings, GMC          : 0\nCodec settings, Matrix       : Custom\nPlayTime                     : 1h 17mn\nBit rate                     : 951 Kbps\nWidth                        : 640 pixels\nHeight                       : 368 pixels\nDisplay Aspect ratio         : 16/9\nFrame rate                   : 25.000 fps\nResolution                   : 8 bits\nChroma                       : 4:2:0\nInterlacement                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)           : 0.162\nStreamSize                   : 525 MiB\nWriting library              : XviD 1.2.-127(dev)\nWriting library/Date         : UTC 2006-11-01\n\nAudio #0\nCodec                        : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\nCodec profile                : Joint stereo\nPlayTime                     : 1h 17mn\nBit rate mode                : CBR\nBit rate                     : 128 Kbps\nMinimum bit rate             : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                   : 2 channels\nSampling rate                : 48.0 KHz\nResolution                   : 16 bits\nStreamSize                   : 70.6 MiB\nWriting library              : LAME3.97 \nEncoding settings            : CBR\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:466c3f05100bc285f121aa30ce3f139feff11a5c","amp;dn":"Time+Team+Special+-+Britains+Drowned+World+%285th+May+2008+Xvid%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"466c3f05100bc285f121aa30ce3f139feff11a5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,108,63,5,16,11,194,133,241,33,170,48,206,63,19,159,239,241,26,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
