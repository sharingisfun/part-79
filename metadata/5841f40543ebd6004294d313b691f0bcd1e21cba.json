The Others live undetected among us, functioning almost entirely at night.  They refer to our daylight world as &quot;Dayside&quot; and their own nighttime realm as &quot;Nightside&quot;. \n\nSydney Taine is a female detective who walks the narrow path dividing good from evil, the gray line that separates the daytime from the Nightside.  No one knows much about Taine other than she solves crimes that ordinary detectives can't. \n\nWritten by author Robert Weinberg (Cable) and illustrated by Tom Derenick (Trinity, The Web).\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5841f40543ebd6004294d313b691f0bcd1e21cba","amp;dn":"Nightside+%28Marvel%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5841f40543ebd6004294d313b691f0bcd1e21cba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,65,244,5,67,235,214,0,66,148,211,19,182,145,240,188,209,226,28,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
