The project retained the laid-back, slowcore sound of Mazzy Star, and much like Mazzy Star, featured Sandoval's sensuous, hypnotic voice. However, it replaced the psychedelic leanings that Mazzy Star was known for with spare, subtle arrangements that reinforced Sandoval's gentle vocal style. In 2000, Sandoval issued her first EP with the Warm Inventions, &quot;At the Doorway Again&quot;, and followed it up with her debut full-length, &quot;Bavarian Fruit Bread&quot;, a year later.The single &quot;Suzanne&quot; appears en 2002 and this year, 2009, the album &quot;Through the Devil Softly&quot;. \n\nThe torrent includes:\n\n*At the doorwar again (EP)\n*Bavarian Fruit Bread\n*Suzanne (single)\n*Through the devil softly\n\nDonÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´t forget seed!\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6deae5e6e30a48acad6dc80d1b73f7845ea892e","amp;dn":"Hope+Sandoval+%26+The+Wvention+-+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6deae5e6e30a48acad6dc80d1b73f7845ea892e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,222,174,94,110,48,164,138,202,214,220,128,209,183,63,120,69,234,137,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
