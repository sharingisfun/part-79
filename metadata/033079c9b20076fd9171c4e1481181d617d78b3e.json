The Goddess Of Mercy is a good example of her strong empathy and noble presence.\n\nThe youngest daughter of a brutal king, the princess openly disapproves of the floggings and cruel treatment her royal family heaps on the peasants. As a result, the heartless king turns on his own daughter forcing her into exile. This humanistic tale will inspire and hearten even the most cynical viewer. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0184537/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0184537/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:033079c9b20076fd9171c4e1481181d617d78b3e","amp;dn":"The+Goddess+of+Mercy+%28Guan+Shi+Yin%29+1967","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"033079c9b20076fd9171c4e1481181d617d78b3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,48,121,201,178,0,118,253,145,113,196,225,72,17,129,214,23,215,139,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
