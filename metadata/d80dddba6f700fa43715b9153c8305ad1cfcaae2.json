The entire thing is like a full time job, but I like to take certain things out of it and put into my own routine.  This is not an attempt to be disrespectful, but I know there are plenty of people who could benefit from this yet cannot afford the pricing.  I have purchased Combat Conditioning and Combat Abs in the past, and support Furey's message in bodyweight exercises and isometrics...I also support those who do not exist inside the business paradigm but still want to learn.
