The screen grabs below don't really do justice to the new Ultimate Edition although there are still some speckles and light marks in the opening but the obvious edge enhancement prevalent in the first release is gone. It is by no means a perfect image but it is significantly improved. \n\nThe Dolby Digital stereo 2.0 optional Spanish track (not available on the original release) sounded very good and it is supported by optional English subtitles (based on the Spanish). You also have a choice of the Russian DUB audio as well as the choice of English subtitles based on that.&quot;\n\n\n\n\nThere is another version of Soy Cuba already on piratebay (thanks to Mazatec), but i believe this to be the superior release. The main difference is the option of removing the Russian overdub. I will be seeding this indefinitely, so regardless of speeds, everyone will be able to download the film with a little patience. Any seeding will be appreciated. All credit for the upload goes to the original uploader DaveBowman at Cinematik. Also, thanks to min0droL for introducing me to the place. This is my first torrent, so please bear with me in case of any screw ups.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73b9ec29a5108f4b681aefc60e6de43c8da19d3d","amp;dn":"Soy+Cuba+%28I+Am+Cuba%29+-+Mikhail+Kalatozov+-+1964","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73b9ec29a5108f4b681aefc60e6de43c8da19d3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,185,236,41,165,16,143,75,104,26,239,198,14,109,228,60,141,161,157,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
