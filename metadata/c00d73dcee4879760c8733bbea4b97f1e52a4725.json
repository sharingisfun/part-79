This was Quicksilver Messenger Service's first album, although they had already produced two songs for the soundtrack of the 1968 movie Revolution. Noted for its instrumental passages (most notably in &quot;Gold and Silver&quot; and &quot;The Fool&quot;), this album displays the group's jam sound amidst lighter pop-oriented songs. Unlike contemporaries such as the Grateful Dead, Quicksilver's jams were highly planned as can be heard by comparing the studio versions of songs with those from bootleg live performances.\n\nThere are three covers and three band compositions on the album, including the 12-minute closer &quot;The Fool.&quot; &quot;Pride of Man&quot; was written by Hamilton Camp, &quot;It's Been Too Long&quot; by producer Nick Gravenites, and &quot;Dino's Song&quot; by ex-founding member Dino Valenti who was at that time in prison due to marijuana-related offenses.\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1. &quot;Pride Of Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08 (Hamilton Camp)\n   2. &quot;Light Your Windows&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:38 (Gary Duncan, David Freiberg)\n   3. &quot;Dino's Song&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:08 (Dino Valenti)\n   4. &quot;Gold and Silver&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:43 (Gary Duncan, S.
