Their memories are hazy; no one can recall how they got there. Alderson (Julian Richings) awakens in a cell, seeks an exit, and arrives in an adjacent cube where he's sliced and diced. Former cop Quentin (Maurice Dean-Wint) becomes the group leader, and he's challenged by conspiracy theorist Dr. Holloway (Nicky Guadagni). Government worker Worth (David Hewlett) remembers a past government link to the project. A discovery that the cubes have numerical codes suggests study by math-student Leaven (Nicole deBoer) while former thief Rennes (Wayne Robson) knows some escape tricks. However, the extreme behavior of Kazan (Andrew Miller) becomes a threat to their survival.\n\n\n\n                                Mpaa Rating++++++++++\n\n                         Rated R for some strong sci-fi violence/gore and language. \n\n\n                                Retail Release Date++++++++\n\n                        11 July 1998\n\n\n                                DVD Content++++++++++\n\n                             \n                 Main Movie+++++++++++++++\n\t              +Video- CCE Encoded - 5 passes\n\t              +Audio-English\t\t\n\t              +Subs-English, Spanish\n\n                 Menu+++++++\n\t              +Yes\t\n              \n                 Extras/Special Features+++++\n\t              +Yes\n\n                 Removed++++++++++++++\n\t              FBI crap and trailers and all of the other annoying and useless stuff.\n\n\n\n                 Chapters++++++++++++++\n1.
