The destruction of the orchestra has an imploding effect on the film reality of the customer showing the co-dependence of viewer and screen.\n\nsummary of film\nThe grotesque form of the Pixilated customer arriving at a corner shop begins The Death of an Orchestra in which the inhabitants of a mysterious mechanical coin operated theatre use a variety of schemes to rob the passer-by of their money. The stopmotion puppet's offer of a free coin entices the customer to spend more to view increasingly shorter performances of their ramshackle music. When the puppets resort to obvious begging tactics the hideous customer, who was at first enchanted by their magical spectacle, becomes angry and destroys the orchestra, finding their destruction means the end of his own existence as the curtains simultaneously close on both viewer and performer.\nStp frame animation by SnakeBeings 2006 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://snakebeings.co.nz/films/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://snakebeings.co.nz/films/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nmore arts:\nhttp://circuit47.com/\n\nHamilton Underground Film Festival:\nhttp://circuit47.com/huff/\n\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;If there are no seeders &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This movie can be downloaded direct from: http://snakebeings.co.nz/films/mpg/ &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f11a918f50de20e0822900e75840998ff9ae8864","amp;dn":"The+Death+of+an+Orchestra+-+by+Snakebeings","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f11a918f50de20e0822900e75840998ff9ae8864","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,26,145,143,80,222,32,224,130,41,0,231,88,64,153,143,249,174,136,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
