As Rock N Roll conquered America, in Britain Skiffle was king. Originating from the folk and trad jazz clubs the exponents of skiffle used improvised instruments such as the washboard, tea chest bass, kazoo, cigar-box fiddle, musical saw, comb and paper, and so forth, as well as more conventional instruments such as acoustic guitar and banjo.
