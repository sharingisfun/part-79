GFW really fucked this shit up. I    \n  mean badly. Do they check their shit before they pre it?     \n                                                               \n  As you can see in the included samples, their release has    \n  obvious ivtc issues. You wouldn't know this by checking      \n  their sample because they were so God damned lazy, they cut  \n  it from the beginning where it was a dark fucking intro at   \n  the very start of the movie that had zero movement. Way to   \n  go. So I had to use MY time/credits to download their piece  \n  of shit release and cut a sample that they should have       \n  included in the first place.                                 \n                                                               \n  Also, their nfo shows that there were subs with the movie.   \n  ORLY?! Everywhere I checked I could not for the life of me   \n  find a sub dir. So I was kind enough to include them with    \n  our release.                                                 \n                                                               \n  I don't mind a group getting a release out before us,        \n  that's fine. That's how the scene is sometimes. But fuck     \n  man, atleast have some pride and do it right. Fixing         \n  someone else's bullshit mistakes pisses me off more than     \n  actually losing a title.                                     \n                                                               \n  Anyways...
