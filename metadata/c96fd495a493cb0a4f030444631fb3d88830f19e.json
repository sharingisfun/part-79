An Associated Press investigation found more than 27,000 abandoned sites are in danger of leaking, with about 13 percent said to be particularly worrisome. Regulations forcing companies to plug the wells have been routinely ignored with no government intervention. We speak with Jeff Donn, the AP reporter who broke the story.\n\n\n- ProPublica: BP Texas Refinery Had Huge Toxic Release Just Before Gulf Blowout\n\nJust over three months ago, thousands of pounds of toxic chemicals begin spewing into the skies from BPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s massive oil refinery in Texas City. The release began on April 6, two weeks before the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, but it took BP weeks to even realize there was a problem. BP now estimates 538,000 pounds of chemicals escaped from the refinery over a 40-day period.

A jury in Los Angeles convicted Merserle of involuntary manslaughter but he was acquitted on the more serious charges of second-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter.\n\n\n- Gary Rivlin on &quot;Broke, USA: From Pawnshops to Poverty, Inc.Ã¢â‚¬â€œHow the Working Poor Became Big Business&quot;\n\nIn his latest book, bestselling author and journalist Gary Rivlin says the rapacious practices of subprime lenders laid the foundation for powerful mainstream banks to get into the subprime business and turn it into a multi-billion dollar enterprise.
