If after testing it you see that you like it and it's useful for you, show your support by buying it!\n\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ed23a01aefcc4594c45cd54382c2f71c5246134","amp;dn":"1Click+DVD+Copy+Pro+4.0.6.0+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ed23a01aefcc4594c45cd54382c2f71c5246134","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,210,58,1,174,252,196,89,76,69,205,84,56,44,47,113,197,36,97,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
