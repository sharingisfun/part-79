That's why I've included the .srt and .sup files. It'd be great if anyone(a Japanese speaking anyone) could take the time to fill the gaps or make the necessary corrections where needed.\n\n\nand here's the corrected .SUP file. if you feel the need you can re-author it in 30 min.\nunfortunately it seems thelink isn't accepted. if you need the corrected .SUP file let me know,","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2155db24c8a667aa398f8ddfeea4026146d391d7","amp;dn":"Natsu+no+im%C3%83%C2%B4to+aka+Dear+Summer+Sister","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2155db24c8a667aa398f8ddfeea4026146d391d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,85,219,36,200,166,103,170,57,143,141,223,238,164,2,97,70,211,145,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
