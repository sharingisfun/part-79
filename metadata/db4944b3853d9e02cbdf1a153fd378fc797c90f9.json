Lee Tracy is once again cast as a seemingly disreputable type with a heart of gold, in this case an expatriate ex-GI named Eddie. Believing that he'd be willing to sell out his country, a Japanese spy ring approach Eddie and ask him to get his hands on secret American war plans. But Eddie is still a true-blue Son of Uncle Sam; at the behest of Army Intelligence, Eddie agrees to play counterspy, using dictaphones, phony messages and other such devices to pull the wool over the enemy's eyes. The results aren't very pretty for either Eddie or his fellow counterspy Peggy (Nancy Kelly), though the audience can take some comfort in the fact that their sacrifice was for the good of Democracy. Fairly slow going during most of its 82 minutes, Betrayal From the East comes to a startling conclusion as Peggy suffers mightily at the hands of her Japanese captors. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037538/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037538/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:22:10\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 720x544 4:3\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 1171 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,13 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db4944b3853d9e02cbdf1a153fd378fc797c90f9","amp;dn":"Betrayal+from+the+East+%281945%29+Lee+Tracy+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db4944b3853d9e02cbdf1a153fd378fc797c90f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,73,68,179,133,61,158,2,203,223,26,21,63,211,120,252,121,124,144,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
