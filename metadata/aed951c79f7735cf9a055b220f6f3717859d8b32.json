The single &quot;If You Could Only See&quot; reached #11 on the Billboard Airplay Hot 100, and Lemon Parade itself reached platinum status.\nTonic spent much of the next two years touring, adding to its reputation as a relentlessly gigging band. In addition to extensive touring Tonic produced other work, including songs for feature film soundtracks. After self-producing their 1999 album Sugar and releasing their third album Head on Straight in 2002, the band went on hiatus beginning in 2004 while its members pursued other musical endeavors. The band became active again in late 2008, embarking on a tour and releasing a greatest hits compilation.
