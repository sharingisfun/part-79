This show also featured a Beacon-esque parade of special guests in the second set, all of whom added to the show.\n\nThe first set got off to strong start with the classic combo of &quot;Don't Want You No More/It's Not My Cross To Bear&quot; and never let up!  This was a bluesy first set, with Warren wailing on &quot;44 Blues&quot; and &quot;The Same Thing,&quot; and Gregg digging in deep on &quot;End Of The Line&quot; and &quot;Leave My Blues At Home.&quot;  For the second time in the run, they played a new, extended jam in &quot;Midnight Rider&quot; that really allows Derek to soar, and the second appearance of &quot;Egypt&quot; confirmed that it is back in the rotation.  A spirited &quot;Revival&quot; wrapped up the first set in style!\n\nThe second set began with avant-blues legend James &quot;Blood&quot; Ulmer on guitar.  The ABB played his tune &quot;I Asked For Water (And She Gave Me Gasoline)&quot; for the first time ever, and the mesh of styles worked out perfectly!  A ripping &quot;One Way Out&quot; and the second Palace performance of Bob Dylan's &quot;Blind Willie McTell&quot; followed, before Soulive guitarist Eric Krasno took the stage for Little Milton's classic &quot;That's What Love Will Make You Do.&quot;  This funky tune is custom-made for Krasno's laid-back, in the pocket style, and Warren kills the vocals!\n\nAn epic &quot;In Memory of Elizabeth Reed&quot; ended the set, with dazzling solos all around and an intriguing &quot;JaMaBuBu&quot; segment in the middle.  A powerful version of &quot;Southbound&quot; with both Krasno and former Phil and Friends keyboardist Rob Barraco put an exclamation point on another great show!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42a0664e54ce1b57340adc37281c687c8c4986bc","amp;dn":"The+Allman+Brothers+-+LIVE+03%2F16%2F2010+%5B320k+MP3%5D+NYC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42a0664e54ce1b57340adc37281c687c8c4986bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,160,102,78,84,206,27,87,52,10,220,55,40,28,104,124,140,73,134,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
