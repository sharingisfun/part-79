They're all low quality (128kbs mp3), but good luck finding better ones. Not sure which of these are unreleased and which are available, so I included every one I found. The composer apparently doesn't want to release them, but I happen to want to listen to them, so yeah.\n\nTracks:\n\nAction Radius\nAlways Outnumbered, Never Outgunned\nArms Bazaar\nA.E.X\nAntilogic\nAudio Adrenaline\nConfrontation\nDisclosure\nEvil Approaching\nFreqency\nInterference\nInvisible Enemy\nOperation Skynet\nPressure Zone\nQuad Machine\nRedemption March\nSpeed Junkie\nSynthetic Machine\nSwallowed\nStemcell\nT3:War of the Machines Remix\nThe Waste Land\nThe Prophecy\nVelocity of Fear\nYou Only Live Once\nWhatever else I happened to miss.\n\nI'll be seeding whenever I'm not playing video games online.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:debb9349039691293cc3c350154e84f547b91752","amp;dn":"Sonic+Mayhem+-+Unreleased+Tracks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"debb9349039691293cc3c350154e84f547b91752","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,187,147,73,3,150,145,41,60,195,195,80,21,78,132,245,71,185,23,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
