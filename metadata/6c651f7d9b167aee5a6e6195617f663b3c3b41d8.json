Dreams of flashy cars, first kisses,\nholiday romance ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and Fun with a capital F ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ were all served up as\nthree-minute slices of life, with five voices in perfect harmony and\nsophisticated chord changes which became the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s trademark sound.\n\nIn an interview earlier this year, Brian Wilson said that the band wanted\nto celebrate the sunny carefree environment they lived in: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“We wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t\nhave been the same band if weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d grown up in the Midwest. The sunshine\nand the girls are always there in the backbeat of our music, they always\nshine through.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\n\nMany changes in both musical style and personnel have occurred during\nthe bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 48-year history, notably because of Brian WilsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mental\nillness and drug use, leading to his eventual withdrawal from the group,\nand the deaths of Dennis in 1983 and Carl in 1998.\n\nThe surviving members, now all in their late 60s, continue to tour in three\nseparate bands: The Beach Boys Band, with Mike Love and a rotation of\nbacking musicians; Al JardineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Endless Summer Band with Jardine, his\nsons and several former Beach Boys backup musicians; and Brian\nWilson with a ten-piece band including long-time Beach Boys backup\nguitarist/ singer Jeff Foskett.\n\n\n   1.
