I'll be doing this every day, as long as people seed.\n\nUPDATE:\nYes, KABC does in fact release the previous day's episode in what they call &quot;podcast&quot; form (thought it's far from that). While KABC does have the original show, the version they release (in three parts), is far from great. It was encoded as a 32 kbps MP3 in mono and sounds terrible compared to the live version. I can understand why KABC would do this, though: bandwidth saving. That's why they need to turn to BitTorrent! ;)\n\nEnjoy, and please...seed!\n\nDetails:\n\nDate Recorded - October 14, 2009\nFile Format - MP3\nBit Rate - 128 kbps\nSample Rate - 44.100 kHz\nFile Size - 99.5 MB\nChannels - Joint Stereo\nLength - 108 Minutes, 50 Seconds","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f4a449d696ab51d7a8d7b19efe25ceeb7234864","amp;dn":"The+Frosty%2C+Heidi%2C+and+Frank+Show+-+October+14%2C+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f4a449d696ab51d7a8d7b19efe25ceeb7234864","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,74,68,157,105,106,181,29,122,141,123,25,239,226,92,238,183,35,72,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
