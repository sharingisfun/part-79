Having been out partying in the company of David Enthoven and Richard Palmer-James the night before in Munich, he still manages an impressive performance on Doctor Diamond and indeed throughout the rest of the gig. Though the good Doctor would forever elude them in the studio it seems that the band really beginning to find the soul of this song in concert. Fracture has a risky quality tonight; Bruford is in an adventurous mood whilst DavidÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tron is a touch out of tune. However he wreaks havoc on the Hohner by way of compensation as Fripp and co rock out. Short but terribly sweet, one canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t help but wonder where the improv with its gorgeous violin outing might have ended up had it not been prematurely guided into the direction of Exiles. Whilst the improv Augsburg appeared on the 21st Century Guide To King Crimson, this is the first time the whole concert has been made available.\n\nTracklisting:\n\n01 Dr Diamond 5:21\n02 Lament 4:10\n03 Easy Money 7:13\n04 Fracture 11:02\n05 The Night Watch 4:28\n06 The Great Deceiver 3:48\n07 Starless 11:19\n08 Improv Augsburg 1:33\n09 Exiles 6:37\n10 Larks' Tongues In Aspic Pt II (Incomplete) 2:52\n\n\nAudio Source: Board Recording\n\nPersonnel:\n\nBill Bruford - Drums, Percussion\nDavid Cross - Violin, Viola, Mellotron, Electric Piano\nRobert Fripp - Guitar, Mellotron\nJohn Wetton - Bass Guitar &amp; Lead Vocal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09a6ebefe121ce87ac4eb159b2b38ce8fcfb4065","amp;dn":"King+Crimson+-+Live+in+Augsburg+Mar+27+1974","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09a6ebefe121ce87ac4eb159b2b38ce8fcfb4065","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,166,235,239,225,33,206,135,172,78,177,89,178,179,140,232,252,251,64,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
