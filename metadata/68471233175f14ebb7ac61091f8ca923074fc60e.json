After experimenting with \nmany different methods, techniques and gimmicks, we feel confident in recommending \nthe following method as the best way to ensure that your RiffTrax stays synched up \nwith the DVD.  If drift should occur between RiffTrax and the DVD, we simply gauge \nhow off the timing is, using the handy Disembaudio narrator, then pause the DVD \nor the RiffTrax, (which ever one is ahead, obviously), and then unpause after \nwe feel an appropriate interval has passed, (usually no more than a second.)  \nThis can be repeated as many times as necessary.  It's not pretty, but it works \ndarn well.  \n\nn\nIf your power goes out, or the phone rings, or you simply want to rewind the nude \nscenes, we've provided the below guides.  They breakdown the DVD's chapters, and \nindicate the timecode of each RiffTrax at the chapter markers.  This should make it \neasier for you to synch up the RiffTrax with the chapter you want to rewind to.\n\nPlease note that all times are approximate and should be used simply as a guide.  \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t-= New Moon =-\n\n\n\tTIMECODE SYNCH\n        RiffTrax | DVD\n1.\t2:32.....0:17       \n2.      13:17....11:02...\n3.      22:11....19:56....\n4.      30:29....28:14....\n5.      37:52....35:37....\n6.      44:26....42:11....\n7.      49:21....47:06....\n8.      56:22....54:07....\n9.      1:00:54..58:39....\n10.     1:06:59..1:04:35..\n11.     1:11:23..1:09:08....\n12.     1:18:08..1:15:53....\n13.     1:22:20..1:20:05....\n14.     1:29:53..1:27:38....\n15.     1:36:20..1:34:05....\n16.     1:44:57..1:42:42....\n17.     1:53:17..1:51:02....\n18.     2:02:24..2:00:09....\n\n\n\n\n \n                              -= DISEMBAUDIO SYNCH LINES =-\n\nRiffTrax  |  Line                            |   DVD\n\n3:19\t   Like fire and powder\n\t\t\t\t \t\t  1:04\n\n5:35\t   I thought we agreed no presents\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  3:20\n\n14:37\t   Gotta stop talking about that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  12:22\n \n24:04\t   Carlye's supposed to be ten years older than he looks\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  21:49\n\n32:29\t   But in a way I'm glad\n\t\t\t\t \t\t  30:14 \n\n41:25\t   Remember I said she's a girl and a friend\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  39:09\n\n51:34\t   You like action movies?\n\t\t\t\t \t\t  49:18\n\n59:46\t   Maybe, gimme like some time or something\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  57:31\n\n1:09:20\t   There's gotta be something that you can do\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  1:07:04\n \n1:17:59\t   She keeps coming back, we don't know what she's after\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  1:15:44\n\n1:26:47\t   Lost it for a split second\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  1:24:22\n\n1:35:04\t   Well what about your dad\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  1:32:48\n \n1:43:17\t   C'mon guys, it's a festival\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  1:41:02\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68471233175f14ebb7ac61091f8ca923074fc60e","amp;dn":"NewMoon_RiffTrax.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68471233175f14ebb7ac61091f8ca923074fc60e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,71,18,51,23,95,20,235,183,172,97,9,31,140,169,35,7,79,198,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
