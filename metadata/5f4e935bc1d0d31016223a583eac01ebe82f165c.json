(See also First Kill, released in '86 but featuring the debut album lineup and consists of various then-unreleased early tracks). Spellbound is also notable for including a young John Sykes on guitar, who would later go on to fame and fortune with Thin Lizzy, Whitesnake, and Blue Murder. The band's decision to move to a more mainstream, pop-metal sound on their subsequent releases was in retrospect a questionable move, as fans of the early material were turned off and the anticipated new audience never really materialized. Amidst lineup changes and poor reviews, the band finally called it a day after the release of Burning In The Shade.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f4e935bc1d0d31016223a583eac01ebe82f165c","amp;dn":"TYGERS+OF+PAN+TANG+-+BBC+In+Concert+%281981%29+UK+-+80s+Geophagus+se","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f4e935bc1d0d31016223a583eac01ebe82f165c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,78,147,91,193,208,211,16,22,34,58,88,62,172,1,235,232,47,22,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
