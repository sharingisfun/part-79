ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA lot of the songs on this album deal with wanting to be done with a relationship but youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re just not really ready to leave, so you hang around and wait for a person to change. I really wanted the lyrical content to be real conversation. I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want anything to be sugar-coated.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nA official remix premiered on Hot 97 on July 21, it features Nas, Jadakiss, Rick Ross and Kain.
