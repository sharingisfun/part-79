I'd encourage everyone to link to guides they like, so that we can come to an agreement on best settings.\n---\nwould everyone like this to be like the portable version, blend them into one, or have both?\n---\n\nI forgot to mention that from now on, the toolbox will be both a list of recommended programs discussion and input from users, and an actual torrent.\nat this point there are still good arguments for including them and for not including them. feedback on your preference would be appreciated.\n\nlisting url pro: links to official, current release; doesn't add to torrent size\nincluding in torrent pro: all the work is done, if the user has to follow the link and get 8 tiny programs that would be in the torrent anyway, then including them saves allot of time.\ncon: constantly updated torrent to reflect new versions. seeders loose their torrent when new one upped.
