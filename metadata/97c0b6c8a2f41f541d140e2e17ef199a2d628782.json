Ahoy to that!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97c0b6c8a2f41f541d140e2e17ef199a2d628782","amp;dn":"The+Pacific+%5B10+Part+Mini-Series%5D+-+Complete++%28XviD%2FMP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97c0b6c8a2f41f541d140e2e17ef199a2d628782","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,192,182,200,162,244,31,84,29,20,14,46,23,239,25,154,45,98,135,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
