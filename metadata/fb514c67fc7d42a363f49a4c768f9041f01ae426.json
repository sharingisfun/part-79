After thirteen years of domestic abuse at the hands of her husband James Berlin (&quot;Mickey&quot;) Hughes, she set fire to the bed he was sleeping in on March 9, 1977. James Hughes was killed and the house destroyed in the resulting inferno.\n\nOn the night of the fire, Hughes told her children to put their coats on and wait for her in the car. She then started the fire with gasoline poured around the bed Mickey Hughes was sleeping in. After the house had caught fire, Hughes drove with her three children to the local police station in order to confess.\n\nHughes was tried in Lansing and found by a jury of her peers to be not guilty by reason of insanity.\n\nHaving turned the book into a made-for-television movie, McNulty's screenplay, &quot;The Burning Bed&quot; premiered on NBC on October 8, 1984. The movie, directed by Robert Greenwald, starred Farrah Fawcett as Francine Hughes and Paul LeMat as Mickey Hughes.\n\n\n\nLanguages: English, Spanish\n\nSubs:      English, French, Spanish\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.33:1 \nFull Screen\nClosed Captioned\nNTSC\n\n\n\nUntouched\n\n\n\n\n                                      R.I.P \n                                 Farrah Fawcett \n                         (February 2, 1947 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ June 25, 2009)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb514c67fc7d42a363f49a4c768f9041f01ae426","amp;dn":"The+Burning+Bed+%281984%29++DVD-R++NTSC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb514c67fc7d42a363f49a4c768f9041f01ae426","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,81,76,103,252,125,66,163,99,244,154,76,118,143,144,65,240,26,228,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
