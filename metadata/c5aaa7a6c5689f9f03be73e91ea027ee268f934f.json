Their 1995 World Cup triumph offered the whole nation the chance to celebrate together for the first time; and with the onset of the SANZAR era came the opportunity for the sport to grow further still.\n\nThis exciting programme follows the fortunes of the Springboks over the past ten years, paying particular attention to their involvement in the now world renowned Tri Nations series. The viewer is taken on a rollercoaster of a ride, reliving all of South Africas successes and failures, including the Springboks awe inspiring series wins in 1998 and 2004.\n\nFeaturing the best action from the last decade of South African Rugby and including interviews with Springbok greats such as Gary Teichman, Chester Williams, Jean De Villiers and many, many more, this DVD is a must have for any Springbok supporter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5aaa7a6c5689f9f03be73e91ea027ee268f934f","amp;dn":"Rugby+-+A+Decade+of+the+Springboks+-+South+Africa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5aaa7a6c5689f9f03be73e91ea027ee268f934f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,170,167,166,197,104,159,159,3,190,115,233,30,160,39,238,38,143,147,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
