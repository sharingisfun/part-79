Pedro (Hique Gomez) is a lower-class factory worker who is fired as the film begins. He is handed a container full of cash as severance pay and becomes embroiled with street kids, a cab driver, and police officers. He eventually pays for a lavish birthday dinner for his wife, Margarette (Ilana Kaplan), but eventually reality settles in. Margarette's Feast was screened at the Rio de Janeiro Festival and the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Margarettes Feast.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 896 MiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 19mn\n      Bit rate : 1568 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 5.08 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n      IAS1 : ???\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Custom\n      PlayTime : 1h 19mn\n      Bit rate : 1340 Kbps\n      Width : 672 pixels\n      Height : 368 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 16/9\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.224\n      StreamSize : 764 MiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 1h 19mn\n      Bit rate : 223 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      StreamSize : 127 MiB\n\nIMDB: tt0260023\n\nNo spoken language\n\nPosted at Karagarga by pagan50","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c812a58d63d26cb1e5f5400912271fea1086170","amp;dn":"Margarette%5C%27s+Feast+%282003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c812a58d63d26cb1e5f5400912271fea1086170","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,129,42,88,214,61,38,203,30,95,84,0,145,34,113,254,161,8,97,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
