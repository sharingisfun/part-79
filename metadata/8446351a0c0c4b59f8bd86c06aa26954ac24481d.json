There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% &amp; the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console.\n\nIf your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first\nremove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.\n\nHere's a link for how to remove the front cover...\n        &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.modchipstore.com/support/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=49&amp;nav=0,2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.modchipstore.com/support/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=49&amp;nav=0,2&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAnd here's some links on using the slide tool to open the tray to swap in your ps2 copy or backup game.\n        &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.swapmagic3.com/slide-tool/Instructions.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.swapmagic3.com/slide-tool/Instructions.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/340944&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/340944&lt;/a&gt;\n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/15105&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/15105&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThose that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot &amp; how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games. Free Mc Boot won't work on newer models of ps2 you'll have to use an older version the tutorial explains this.\n\n-- &lt;a href=&quot; http://bootleg.sksapps.com/tutorials/fmcb/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://bootleg.sksapps.com/tutorials/fmcb/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThen you will also need to patch the iso (the PS2 game) with ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a if your using free mc boot with ESR Elf to boot your p2 copies or backups (No-swapping required for esr method).\n\nAfter patching burn the iso with Imgburn or Dvd Decrypter to respectable media\nthen use the ESR through fmcb after you installed everything to boot your game.\n\nYou will still need to use the proper media for the game to run or load properly regardless if your using fmcb, a modded ps2, or swap magic. Verbatim or Tayio yuden is preferred.\n\nNote: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Swap Magic should do the\ntrick.\n\n\nDescription:\n\nThis is not a Game. This is A Network Adapter Startup Disc, That will guide you through and setup your network configuration for online play on your ps2.  You can use a Slim Ps2 or a Fat Ps2 with the Network Adapter. It will provide step by step instructions and config your setup for you. \n\nYou'll of course need a Network cable, same one you use to hook up a computer to a router for online. You have to hook the cable to your ps2 and directly into your online router (same as you would for a computer for a direct connection) &amp; during setup you can't hook in to your computer through the ps2, that won't work I've tried.\n\nYou shouldn't have any problems the disc explains and walks you thru all this.\n\n\nPic Included.\n\n\nBurn with DVD Decrypter, (Included in download).  \n\nBest to burn at 8x or 4x speed.\n\nUse Verbatim Or use Tayio Yuden DVD+R or DVD-R Media for best quality.\n\nUsing any other media might not work at all.\n\nIf using DVD+R then booktype to DVD-ROM \n(If your mod-chip, or Ps2 doesn't support DVD+R).\n\n\nAny Problems or questions please post a comment.\n\n\nIf this is working fine for you let us know write a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\n(I can't seed 24/7, do your part and seed to keep the torrent healthy).\n\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8446351a0c0c4b59f8bd86c06aa26954ac24481d","amp;dn":"Network+Adapter+Start-up+Disc+%28Online+Setup%29+%5BNTSC%5D%2C+PS2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8446351a0c0c4b59f8bd86c06aa26954ac24481d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,70,53,26,12,12,75,89,248,189,134,192,106,162,105,84,172,36,72,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
