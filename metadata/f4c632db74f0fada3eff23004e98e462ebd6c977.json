The meeting related protests took place in Miami, Florida in November 2003. The Miami Model is also the title of a documentary film, produced by Indymedia, about the FTAA, the police action in Miami, and political organizing led by people of color in the Miami area.[1]\n\nThis term refers to the distinctive features of crowd control technique used in Miami, which included large scale pre-emptive arrests, heavily armed sometimes unidentifiable law enforcement, the collection of intelligence from protesters, and the &quot;embedding&quot; of corporate media with the police.[2]\n\nMiami Activist Defense and National Lawyers Guild filed a federal lawsuit against the City, the Mayor, Police Chief Timoney, Homeland Defense Secretary Ridge, and Attorney General Ashcroft for rampant abuse of the constitution.\n\nAmong the groups which organized against the FTAA were the Green Bloc, United for Peace and Justice, Root Cause, several AFL-CIO affiliated unions, Midwest Unrest, Pittsburgh Organizing Group, Food Not Bombs and many others.\n(Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_model)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4c632db74f0fada3eff23004e98e462ebd6c977","amp;dn":"The+Miami+Model+%28Indymedia+Documentary%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4c632db74f0fada3eff23004e98e462ebd6c977","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,198,50,219,116,240,250,218,62,255,35,0,78,152,228,98,235,214,201,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
