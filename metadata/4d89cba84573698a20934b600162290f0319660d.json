Released in 1990 as the album's fourth single, it peaked at #19 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nDr. Feelgood is the fifth album by hard rock band MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e, released on September 1, 1989.\n\nThe lyrics of &quot;Don't Go Away Mad (Just Go Away)&quot; feature a reference to a previous song by the band, &quot;Too Young to Fall in Love.&quot;\n\nLars Ulrich and Metallica looked to Bob Rock to produce The Black Album, after being impressed with his production work on this album.\n\nNike SB created a shoe based on the album cover.\n\nDr. Feelgood topped the Billboard 200 (North America) chart, being the first album MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e had recorded after their quest for sobriety and rehabilitation in 1989. It is widely regarded by music critics and fans as being MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e's strongest and bestselling album.\n\nDr. Feelgood has sold more than 6 million copies in the U.S. alone, and went Gold in the U.K.. In various interviews, members of MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e stated that it was their most solid album from a musical standpoint, due in no small part to their collective push for sobriety.\n\nThe song &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot; was ranked #15 on VH1 Greatest Hard Rock Songs and #41 on VH1's 100 Greatest '80s Songs.\n\nAs of October 14, 2008, the album, minus the opening track &quot;T.N.T. (Terror 'N Tinseltown)&quot; because of length and playability, has become downloadable content for the video game Rock Band.\n\n&quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot; and &quot;Kickstart My Heart&quot; were both nominated for Grammy awards for Best Hard Rock Performance, but lost twice to Living Colour.\n\nTo mark the twentieth anniversary of the album MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e is performing the album in its entirety at CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e Fest 2.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d89cba84573698a20934b600162290f0319660d","amp;dn":"Motley+Crue+-+Don%5C%27t+Go+Away+Mad+%28Live%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d89cba84573698a20934b600162290f0319660d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,137,203,168,69,115,105,138,32,147,75,96,1,98,41,15,3,25,102,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
