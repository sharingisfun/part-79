Hadinger, a former federal agent with a top-secret clearance, wrote this gripping, behind-the-scenes examination of the plagues that have visited America through the deliberate, subversive leadership of former President William Jefferson Clinton and associates. This &quot;leadership&quot; is pushing this once-proud country toward subservience to the United Nations and a one-world government. The author-patriot's no-holds-barred approach and keen analysis will stir the soul and intellect of any reader truly interested in learning the depths to which this Administration has plunged his &quot;Amerika.&quot; With willing major-media assistance, Comrade and Mrs. Clinton have pulled the proverbial wool over the eyes of the unsuspecting taxpayers of the United States. Hadinger has produced a work with pages and pages of documentation that supports his thesis. With the facts and evidence, he sends a stern warning that doesn't spare Democrats or Republicans. Will this be the book that serves as a wake-up call for the slumbering masses being led down the path to certain destruction? This book is a must read for all Americans concerned about this country. 350 pages. A must read for everyone.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90ca71dbf5d7da16aa73026f96e172beab65e9b1","amp;dn":"Hadinger-Clinton%5C%27s+Carnage+of+Congress%2CConstitution%26Country%281","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90ca71dbf5d7da16aa73026f96e172beab65e9b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,202,113,219,245,215,218,22,170,115,2,111,150,225,114,190,171,101,233,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
