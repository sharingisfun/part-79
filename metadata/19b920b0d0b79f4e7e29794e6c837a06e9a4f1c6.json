Rather than become a strain on their new marriage and their nomadic lifestyle, Bella instead chooses to sacrifice her happiness and moves in with her father in one of the coldest and wettest places in the Continental US.  But while the cold and the wet are definitely not two of Bella's favorite things, the town of Forks quickly begins to grow on her.\n\nWithin hours of moving in to town and getting started at school, Bella's eyes are drawn to the extraordinarily beautiful enigma that is Edward Cullen.  Handsome, confident, pale, and perfect, Edward first treats her with near-anger and frustration, but when she sees him again, his demeanor is completely different, and soon, the mystery of Edward is soon overshadowed by her head-over-heels love story.  This series is the story of the romance of Bella and Edward.  It is a Romeo and Juliet story, though with some definite twists and curves in the classic Shakespearean format.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOk, so I uploaded these before, but I recently found a set of MP3's which someone else had done all the work for.  They edited the original Audible.com conversions and got rid of all of the Audible.com file-breaks, edited the repeat chapters, and split the files into chapter files instead of regular breaks.  Plus, a lot of the little audio pops and fizzles have been fixed.  The person who did this was keikii of ThePirateBay.  keikii's torrents also included .m4b versions, but they were much lower quality and didn't sound very good to my ears.  So, I've reconverted from keikii's mp3s at a higher quality, edited his chapter titles a bit and included all the names Stephenie Meyer gave them, and also tagged and readied them for perfectly smooth iPod playback.\n\nFor those fans who are also fans of the films, I've also uploaded a high-quality version of &quot;Twilight&quot;.  Click on my username and search for it.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdditional Info\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike all my iPod torrents, these files have their ID3 tags preformatted for your ease!  Album Art, Release Dates, and TV Tags are already filled out for you.  However, if you wish to change them, I recommend the third-party tagging program TVTagger!\n\nFor VoV's iPod Downloads throughvisit RapidRise! &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rapidrise.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rapidrise.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCheck out VoV's Blog at BayWords!
