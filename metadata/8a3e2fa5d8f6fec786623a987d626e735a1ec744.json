The Walt Disney Company, then Walt Disney Studios, was plagued by many financial woes in the World War II era. Hench compiled a short animation test of about 18 seconds in the hopes of rekindling Disney's interest in the project, but the production was no longer deemed financially viable and put on indefinite hiatus.\n\nIn 1999, Walt Disney's nephew Roy Edward Disney, while working on Fantasia 2000, unearthed the dormant project and decided to bring it back to life. Disney Studios France, the company's small Parisian production department, was brought on board to complete the project. The short was produced by Baker Bloodworth and directed by French animator Dominique Monfrey in his first directorial role. A team of approximately 25 animators deciphered DalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­ and Hench's cryptic storyboards (with a little help from the journals of DalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­'s wife Gala DalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­ and guidance from Hench himself), and finished Destino's production. The end result is mostly traditional animation, including Hench's original footage, but it also contains some computer animation. The 18 second original footage that is included in the finished product is the segment with the two tortoises.\n\nDestino premiered on June 2, 2003 at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival in Annecy, France. The six-minute short follows the love story of Chronos and the ill-fated love he has for a mortal female. The story continues as the female dances through surreal scenery inspired by DalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­'s paintings. There is little dialogue, but the sound track features a song by the Mexican composer Armando Dominguez.\n\n    [ IMdB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377770/ | Rating: 8.0 / 10 (492 votes) ]\n                                     \n[General]===================================\n                                                                  \nComplete name                    : Destino.2003.DVDRip.x264.AC3-KARiNA.mkv\nFormat                           : Matroska\nFile size                        : 342 MiB\nDuration                         : 6mn 46s\nOverall bit rate                 : 7 058 Kbps\nSource                           : Unreleased NTSC DVD5\n\n[Video]=====================================                                 \n\nFormat                           : AVC\nCodec ID                         : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nBit rate                         : 6 726 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                 : 8 000 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16/9\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nStandard                         : NTSC\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.649\nStream size                      : 326 MiB (95%)\nWriting library                  : x264 core 65\n\n[Audio]=====================================                              \n\nFormat                           : AC-3\nCodec ID                         : A_AC3\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 9.31 MiB (3%)\n\n[Chapters]==================================\n\n00:00:00.000                     : Chapter 1\n00:01:21.206                     : Chapter 2\n\n[KARiNA]===================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a3e2fa5d8f6fec786623a987d626e735a1ec744","amp;dn":"Destino.2003.DVDRip.x264.AC3-KARiNA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a3e2fa5d8f6fec786623a987d626e735a1ec744","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,62,47,165,216,246,254,199,134,98,58,152,125,98,110,115,90,30,199,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
