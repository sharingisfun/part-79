Certainty in you finding new music that you will love; I guarantee it.]\n\nI once found an archive of tracks that someone had uploaded to \nwith the self-assured title of &quot;Seriously Cool Driving Music.&quot;\n\nUpon further review, I found it to be a mere scraping of top 40 \ntracks from the 21st century, sprinkled with a few \none-hit wonders with laughable replay value. To state my \ndisappointment succinctly, let me just tell you that \none of the tracks was &quot;Hey There Delilah&quot; by the Plain White T's.\n\nThe silver lining to this seemingly wasted bandwidth was that it inspired \nme to take a crack at making a similar mixtape with the same goal; \nthe main difference being that mine would actually succeed.\nMy years of interest in music caused me to find many tracks \nthat I am fond of having as driving companions. \nContemplative lyrics, melodic vocals and jamming tunes \nthat make me feel like dancing in my seat. I can't describe\nmy taste in music as certain genres because I've found \nbeautifully organized noise in all of them.\nThe kind of music I like is &quot;good music.&quot;\n\nShort enough to fit onto two CD-Rs (separated by folder), this archive includes \nsuch tracks. One CD is designated for daytime driving \nand the other for nighttime driving, though you'll experience enjoyment\nin either without regard to if the Sun is out.\n\n[Enjoy.]\nHeyMrDJ\n\nFull list of included tracks:\n\nHeyMrDJ's Daytime Driving\n\n1 - Bill Withers - Ain't No Sunshine\n2 - The Black Keys - All Hands Against His Own\n3 - The Rolling Stones - As Tears Go By\n4 - Max Romeo &amp; the Upsetters - Chase the Devil\n5 - Jamiroquai - Corner of the Earth\n6 - Elton John - Crocodile Rock\n7 - At the Drive-In - Enfilade\n8 - Fleetwood Mac - Go Your Own Way\n9 - Foreigner - Juke Box Hero\n10 - The Darkness - Love Is Only a Feeling\n11 - Stereophonics - Maybe Tomorrow\n12 - Ray Charles - Mess Around\n13 - Ratatat - Pico\n14 - Boney M - Rasputine\n15 - Scorpions - Rock You Like a Hurricane\n16 - Mark Ronson - Stop Me\n17 - The Hold Steady - Stuck Between Stations\n18 - Bloodhound Gang - Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss\n19 - Men At Work - Who Can It Be Now\n20 - Bob Sinclar - World, Hold On (Children of the Sky) [Radio Edit]\n\nHeyMrDJ's Nighttime Driving\n\n1 - C-Mos - 2 Million Ways\n2 - Nelly Furtado - All Good Things (Come to an End)\n3 - Kasabian - Club Foot\n4 - Neil Young - Don't Let it Bring You Down\n5 - Alan Parsons Project - Don't Let It Show\n6 - Gabrielle - Forget About the World [Daft Punk Remix]\n7 - The Beatles - Golden Slumbers\n8 - Thin Lizzy - Jailbreak\n9 - Arcade Fire - My Body Is a Cage\n10 - Clipse - Nightmares ft.
