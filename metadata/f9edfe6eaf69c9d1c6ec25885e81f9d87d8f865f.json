A few notes, the CD is remastered with bonus tracks. I ripped it in Monkey's Audio format because that's what I rip my files at for my personal use. Any good converter will convert these to Flac or Wav files, or even lossy mp3's if you prefer. You could use the free Monkey's Audio to convert these files to Wav, or use Easy CD-DA extractor or dbpoweramp to convert these directly to your choice format. I even found a plugin for Nero hat burns these files without having to convert first. Bottom line, these are lossless files and the quality is Fantastic! Just burn without pauses and the cd will be gapless.\nSecond Note: I used a program to rip the audio from the DVD so that you can burn a cd if you wish of just the audio. I find the audio is quiet, so I recommend nomalizing the volume when burning the files. I applied track gain but it helps very little I find. You may not even want this for burning, so that's up to you. I omitted the track Prophecy to make the cd fit on an 80 minute cdr.\nLast note: The DVD is untouched, it is the full dvd of the album performed live with extra tracks at the end of the concert. If you don't want to burn it on a double layer disc, I suggest using DVD Shrink to shrink it to fit a 4.3 gb dvdr. I did it this way for the people who want the full quality.\nPlease don't ask me to rip it in a different format. This is free, so it's up to you if you want to take it as is. I think you'll enjoy this as it is a great set! Covers have been scanned also, so there is a lot of music and video here for you to enjoy. Please seed as long as you can as it is a large files, and I can't keep it going alone forever, right? Thanks for reading all this info.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9edfe6eaf69c9d1c6ec25885e81f9d87d8f865f","amp;dn":"JUDAS+PRIEST+-+British+Steel+30th+Anniversary+CD+%26+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9edfe6eaf69c9d1c6ec25885e81f9d87d8f865f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,237,254,110,175,105,201,209,198,236,37,136,94,129,249,216,125,143,134,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
