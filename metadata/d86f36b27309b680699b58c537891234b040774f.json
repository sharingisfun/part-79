The singing is very fast &amp; if you don't understand deep jamacian accents then there is no way you could understand this. Strong jamacian accents, singing really fast. However, if you do understand strong jamacian accents then I highly rate this. Excellent album with a nice feel to it. Requires moderate concentration. Happy Listening :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d86f36b27309b680699b58c537891234b040774f","amp;dn":"Va-Great+British+Mc%5C%27s+%5B1984%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d86f36b27309b680699b58c537891234b040774f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,111,54,178,115,9,182,128,105,155,88,197,55,137,18,52,176,64,119,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
