Focusing on problems he believes will provoke positive and constructive discussion, Russell concentrates on knowledge rather than metaphysics.\n\nRussell guides the reader through his famous distinction between ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œknowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by descriptionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and introduces important theories of Plato, Aristotle, RenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Descartes, David Hume, John Locke, Immanuel Kant, Georg Hegel and others, to lay the foundation for philosophical inquiry by general readers and scholars alike.\n\n(Summary from Wikipedia)\n\n\n\n\nAn M4B file is an audio file which can be bookmarked. This is the audio-book file type. These files can have chapter markers which can be skipped through as you would skip through files on a play list. They can have built in cover art and chapter images. They will remember where you left off each time you stop the file and come back to it . And variable speed settings on Ipods and a growing number of other mp3 players can be utilized by this file type. The ability to bookmark allows for as little as one large file instead of many small ones without the burden of fast forwarding to find your spot every time you resume listening or the fear of otherwise losing your place. The reduced number of files also makes browsing through your files to find your book and your place in it much less effort.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1b1877b1deb8902d89942bc0e7c63e500ff10bc","amp;dn":"Librivox+M4B+Audiobook+-+Problems+of+Philosophy++by+Bertrand+Rus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1b1877b1deb8902d89942bc0e7c63e500ff10bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,177,135,123,29,235,137,2,216,153,66,188,14,124,99,229,0,255,16,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
