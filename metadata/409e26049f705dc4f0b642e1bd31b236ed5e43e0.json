He dreams of taking it to the Bonneville Salt Flats to see how fast it will go. By the early 1960s, heart disease threatens his life, so he mortgages his house and takes a boat to Los Angeles, buys an old car, builds a makeshift trailer, gets the Indian through customs, and heads for Utah. Along the way, people he meets are charmed by his open, direct friendliness. If he makes it to Bonneville, will they let an old guy on the flats with makeshift tires, no brakes, and no chute? And will the Indian actually respond?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhile I usually remember when and where I saw a film because the first time I see a film, I generally remember those kinds of things.  But instead, I don't remember this one, but I do remember when I first saw the trailer for this film and thought it looked awesome.  This is an interesting film starring Anthony Hopkins as Burt Monroe, an elderly gentleman from New Zealand who has dreamed for half his life of traveling to the Bonneville Salt Flats to speed-test his classic Indian motorcycle.\n\n\nI honestly don't know any trivia for this film, so I had to look a few things up:\n1.  Many of the tools in the shed were moved from an Invercargill hardware store where they are on display for posterity and a few pieces of Anthony Hopkins wardrobe were on loan from Burt Monroe's family to provide the film with maximum authenticity.\n2.  Burt Monroe's children visited the set one day for filming, and Anthony Hopkins performance was supposedly so close to authentic, his children were brought to tears.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdditional Info\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike all my iPod torrents, these files have their ID3 tags preformatted for your ease!
