The record is strongest on its latin percussion as the title suggests and is no joke since it features some of the greatest names in the discipline: Armando Peraza, Mongo Santamaria, Willy Bobo. Also get to hear Tjader on timbales (in 'Goza' and 'Alegres Timbales') and bassist Al McKibbon (a disciple of the legendary Chano Pozo) joining Armando Peraza on congas ('Alegres Congas'). &quot;Cubano Chant&quot; should be an instant winner with every listener with the beautiful melody moving from flute to vibes over several rhythmic layouts. But true to the Tjader style it goes beyond percussion and adding to Cal's great work on vibes there are nice contributions by the likes of Chombo Silva, Vince Guaraldi and Bobby Rodriguez. As with many of the newer reissues in CD the music was originally issued in two separate LP's. It offers a great testimony to the artistry of these men who had to typically pack a great solo on a 3-minute track! If you like Latin jazz you will love this record. If you like afro Cuban drumming you must have it. ~ Ramon Melendez\n\nTjader's album is smoking hot. I read the other reviews here before purchasing and can't say I disagree. This is easily one of my favorite Latin albums. \n\nThe vibes are awesome and the percussion is so fast and stylish it will blow your mind. ~ Liam Friedland\n\nPersonnel:\nCal Tjader (vibraphones, timbales);\nGerald Sanfino (alto saxophone, flute);\nJose &quot;Chombo&quot; Silva (tenor saxophone);\nJerome Richardson (flute);\nEddie Cano, Vince Guaraldi, Manuel Duran (piano);\nRichard Wyands (piano, percussion);\nBobby Rodriguez, Eugene Wright (bass);\nAl McKibbon (bass, congas);\nAl Torres (drums);\nArmando Peraza (conga, bongos);\nRamon &quot;Mongo&quot; Santamaria (congas);\nBayardo Velarde (bongos, percussion);\nArmando &quot;Cuco&quot; Sanchez, Willie Bobo, Luis Kant (percussion).\n\nCal Tjader - Los Ritmos Calientes Tracks:\n01  Cubano Chant\n02  Goza\n03  Panchero Mambero\n04  Alegres Timbales\n05  Mambo Moderno\n06  Afro Corolombo\n07  Ritmo Caliente\n08  Lamento De Hodi\n09  Mambo Inn\n10  Buhuto (Nanigo 68)\n11  Alegres Congas\n12  Mueve La Cintura\n13  Bernie's Tune\n14  Perdido\n15  Armando's Hideaway\n16  Cuco On Timbales\n17  Tumbao\n18  Ritmo Rumba\n19  Big Noise from Winnetka\n20  Poinciana Cha Cha\n21  Mongorama\n22  Ritmo Africano\n23  Perfidia Cha Cha","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d438d3db3387edb3de3df9a124992dd4db88e98f","amp;dn":"Cal+Tjader+-+Los+Ritmos+Calientes+%281954%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bschon55","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d438d3db3387edb3de3df9a124992dd4db88e98f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,56,211,219,51,135,237,179,222,61,249,161,36,153,45,212,219,136,233,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
