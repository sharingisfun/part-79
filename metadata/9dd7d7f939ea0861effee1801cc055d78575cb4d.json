He is considered Japan's earliest cyborg superhero, predating even Kamen Rider (the same year, Shotaro Ishinomori created Cyborg 009), and was supposedly the inspiration for RoboCop.\n\nThe manga was published in Weekly ShÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½nen Magazine and ran from 1963 to 1966. The anime series, produced by Eiken with the TCJ Animation Center, was broadcast on Tokyo Broadcasting System, and ran from November 17, 1963 to December 31, 1964, with a total of 56 episodes (plus the &quot;farewell&quot; special episode, &quot;Goodbye, Eightman&quot;).\n\nContents [hide] \n\n\nThe story\nMurdered by criminals, Detective Yokoda's body is retrieved by Professor Tani and taken to his laboratory. There, Tani performs an experiment that has failed seven times; Yokoda is the latest subject to have his life force transferred into an android body. For the first time, the experiment succeeds. Yokoda is reborn as the armor-skinned android 8 Man, able to dash at impossible speeds, as well as shape-shift into other people. He shifts himself into Yokoda, this time christening himself as &quot;Hachiro Azuma&quot;. He keeps this identity a secret, known only to Tani and his police boss Chief Tanaka. Even his girlfriend Sachiko and friend Ichiro don't know he's an android. As 8-Man, Hachiro fights crime (even bringing his murderers to justice). He smoked &quot;energy&quot; cigarettes, to rejuvenate his powers, that he carried in a cigarette case on his belt.\n\n[edit] The US version\nIn 1965, 8 Man was brought to the U.S. as Tobor the 8th Man, with ABC Films as its syndicated distributor. 52 of the original 56 episodes were &quot;converted&quot; into English.\n\nThe characters were renamed as follows:\n\nYokota/Azuma/8 Man - Special Agent Peter Brady/Tobor (&quot;robot&quot; spelled backwards)/8th Man\nTani - Professor Genius\nTanaka - Chief FumbleThumbs\nSachiko - Jenny Hartsweet\nIchiro - Skip\nAnimator Ralph Bakshi created the US version's opening sequence. English lyrics were written by Winston Sharples for the theme song, referencing the FBI in one line, which would not be relevant to the Japanese storyline.\n\nThe lyrics to the US version are as follows:\n\nThere's a prehistoric monster\nThat came from outer space\nCreated by the Martians\nTo destroy the human race.\n\nThe FBI is helpless,\nIt's twenty stories tall.\nWhat can we do? Who can we call?\n\nCall Tobor, the Eighth Man.\nCall Tobor, the Eighth Man.\nFaster than a rocket.\nQuicker than a jet.\nHe's the mighty robot.\nHe's the one to get.\nCall Tobor, the Eighth Man.\nQuick, call Tobor, the mightest robot of them all!\n\nJapanese characters on signs would be mentioned jokingly, along the lines of &quot;I could figure out where we were if the signs weren't written in gibberish&quot;.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dd7d7f939ea0861effee1801cc055d78575cb4d","amp;dn":"8th+Man+%281964%29+5+More+Episodes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dd7d7f939ea0861effee1801cc055d78575cb4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,215,215,249,57,234,8,97,239,254,225,128,28,192,85,215,133,117,203,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
