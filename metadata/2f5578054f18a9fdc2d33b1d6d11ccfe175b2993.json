Not long after producing this internal report, the bank collapsed.\n\nKaupthing's borrowers have or had operations in most countries.\n\nKaupthing previously operated in at least 13 countries, including all the Nordic countries, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nThe bank's motto, prominently displayed in this report is Think Beyond.\n\nWithin 24 hours of releasing the document, WikiLeaks received a legal threat from Kaupthing's lawyers.\n\nAt 18:55 GMT Sat Aug 1, Iceland's national broadcaster, RÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¡V, had its 19:00 nightly newscast enjoyed to prevent reporting the document. Instead RÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¡V showed a link to this page.\n\nAccording to the popular Iceland Weather Report site, the injunction was ordered by the ReykjavÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­k District Commissioner, one RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºnar GuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â°jÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³nsson. As it happens, the son of the ReykjavÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­k District Commissioner, GuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â°jÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºnarsson, is head of the Icelandic Financial Services Association and one of the top spokesmen for the failed banks. Among other things, he has fought to have the stateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Housing Financing Fund [which supplies the general public with affordable mortgages] abolished so that the banks could have exclusive dibs on the mortgage market.\n\nAnother son of the District Commissioner is Frosti Reyr RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºnarsson, who just happens to be the former head of KaupthingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s securities brokerage division and one of the recipients of KaupthingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s infamous bullet loans.[1]\n\nAn article in Visir based on this document revealed that loans made to the core investors of Kaupthing [the brothers ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½gÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºst and LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â°ur GuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â°mundsson], and companies owned by them, amounted to some ISK 300 billion [USD 2.3 bn / EUR 1.6 bn].\n\nRobert Tchenguiz, a member of the board of Exista [owned by the brothers] received loans of some ISK 330 billion.\n\nÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“lafur ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“lafsson, he who once flew in Elton John to perform at his birthday bash [and who is associated with shipping company Samskip], received a loan of some ISK 140 billion.\n\nCompanies associated with the Baugur family received a loan amounting to some ISK 320 billion at the current rate of exchange.
