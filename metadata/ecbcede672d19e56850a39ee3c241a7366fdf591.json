Subiela uses a surrealistic language delivering powerful images and proposals to the audience.\n\nIn The Dark Side Subiela employs a light comedy tone but deep themes are touched: love, death, creativity and the ultimate meaning of life itself.\n\nThe story follows Oliverio's comings and goings to sell his ideas to advertising companies in order to make a living. He is a poet in search of love, desperately looking for a woman that can fly.\nIn his quest he makes love to many female candidates. If they can't fly... well the bed take care of them.\nFinally he meets Ana, a beautiful Uruguayan whore that flies, but she is a pro and demands money. So Oliverio has to strain his imagination to earn enough money to have a three day love tour.\n\nSome scenes in the movie will leave you roaring of laughter: the cow talking to Oliverio with his mother voice; crossing Buenos Aires' crowded streets with an enormous phallus sculpture and the disposal bed are some exhilarating examples.\n\nPoetry with texts from Mario Benedetti and Juan Gelman enrich the story.\nDario Grandinatti has the ideal physique-du-role to impersonate Oliverio and delivers very convincing performance. Sandra Ballesteros' dark beauty gives her Ana a sensual and captivating personality.\nNacha Guevara as the hieratical Death is great.\n\nIt is a great provoking film for adult audiences. Do not miss it you'll be delighted!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/aapifaaba.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/aapifaaba.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/e3.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/e3.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/e4.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/e4.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---not my rip----\n\n\t~~~~~~ El lado oscuro del corazon - (Eliseo Subiela, 1992, Arg).avi ~~~~~~\n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,730,104,316\n\n--- Video Information ---\nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD 1.1.0 Beta 1\nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................2:01:22\nFrame Count:....................................182035\nFrame Width (pixels):...........................672\nFrame Height (pixels):..........................368\nAspect Ratio:...................................1.826\nFrames Per Second:..............................25.000\nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1701\n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................\nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.275&quot;\n\n--- Audio Information ---\nAudio Codec:....................................0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000\nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................192\nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR\nAudio Channel Count:............................2 \n\n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
