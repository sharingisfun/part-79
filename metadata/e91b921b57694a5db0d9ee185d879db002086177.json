I FINALLY managed to actually get them downloaded, No thanks to the pirate bay &gt;.&gt;.  However, I love this site, so I figured I would put them on here and make sure I keep them seeded.  Anyone who downloads these, please also try to seed.  The first two were in mp4 format, I changed them to avi and they seem to work fine.  If anyone has any problems with them, let me know.  Also one last little note, episodes 3 and 4 have an annoying little screen that shows before the episode.  Nothing is wrong with the file, the screen will go away after a min or so.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e91b921b57694a5db0d9ee185d879db002086177","amp;dn":"Naruto+Shippuden+1-4+English+Dubbed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e91b921b57694a5db0d9ee185d879db002086177","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,27,146,27,87,105,74,93,176,217,238,24,93,135,157,176,2,8,97,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
