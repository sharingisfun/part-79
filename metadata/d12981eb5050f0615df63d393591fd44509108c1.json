These neighborhoods of tract homes sprang up all over the US as a direct result of the GI Bill making home loans available to WWII veterans. This is an excellent film for political science class looking at the massive political and cultural change in the quarter century following WWII.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d12981eb5050f0615df63d393591fd44509108c1","amp;dn":"Our+Home+Town%3A+Levittown%2C+PA+%281954%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d12981eb5050f0615df63d393591fd44509108c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,41,129,235,80,80,240,97,93,246,61,57,53,145,253,68,80,145,8,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
