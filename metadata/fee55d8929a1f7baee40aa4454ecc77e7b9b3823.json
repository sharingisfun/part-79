Yet the Bible is full of instruction on this vital subject. Through this DVD you will learn about:\n\nThe cause of a false conversion.\nThe incredible key that unlocks the mystery of all the parables.\nThe six characteristics of a false convert.\nThe factor that proves the genuineness of a true convert.\nWhy a genuine convert will stand no matter how great the adversity.\n\nWhy the Apostle Paul was &quot;exceedingly joyful&quot; in all of his tribulation.\n&quot;That is the reason we have so many mushroom converts . . . why? Because their stony ground is not plowed up; they have not got a conviction of the Law.&quot; George Whitefield \n\nFor more information please visit: http://www.wayofthemaster.com\n\nRuntime: 44 mins\nLanguage: English (No-Subtitles)\nYear: 2006\nMy Rating: 10/10\nQuality: 9/10 \n\nIf financially possible, please buy this CD/DVD to keep Christian films in business. If Christians won't buy Christian films/documentaries then who will? Infact I will say buy the entire set of ray comfort videos. You won't regret it.\n\nPlease seed. Let each one of us who call ourself Christians seed 2-3 movies each. So that these movies may become a blessing to all those who are hungry for God's word &amp; grace. May Jesus bless all those who are seeding the christian torrents.\n\nPS: If you need any specific christian movie/documentary or have something to say then kindly send a mail to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;b9d0d7ddd0d8d7dad1cbd0cacdd0d8d78b898980f9c0d8d1d6d697dad697d0d7&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&quot;Don't ask me what Christ can do for you! \nHe has done all he could. \nTell me what you can do for Christ?&quot;\n\nUploaded by Indian Christian\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fee55d8929a1f7baee40aa4454ecc77e7b9b3823","amp;dn":"True+%26+False+Conversion+%28Christian+Documentary%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fee55d8929a1f7baee40aa4454ecc77e7b9b3823","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,229,93,137,41,161,247,186,238,64,170,68,84,236,199,126,123,155,56,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
