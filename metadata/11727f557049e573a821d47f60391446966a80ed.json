Community activists protested and demanded CPS to undo their decision, claiming that Jeremih's music was &quot;not appropriate for students&quot; and &quot;promotes teen sex&quot;. Huberman argued that &quot;school officials would be naive to pretend students don't listen to Felton's music already&quot;. Daley also argued that recording artists have the freedom of speech, noting that Jeremih was &quot;a young man, [with a] back-to-school message, a young man who has had great success recording, producer, going to school, went to public school&quot;. In September 2009, Jeremih performed on ABC Daytime's soap opera One Life to Live, alongside recording artist Lionel Richie. The two performed &quot;Just Go&quot;, a song from Richie's album with the same title.\n\n\nMy Videos: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11727f557049e573a821d47f60391446966a80ed","amp;dn":"Jeremih+-+Imma+Star+%28Everywhere+We+Are%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11727f557049e573a821d47f60391446966a80ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,114,127,85,112,73,229,115,168,33,212,127,96,57,20,70,150,106,128,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
