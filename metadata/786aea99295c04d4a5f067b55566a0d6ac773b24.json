The series is a medical drama/black comedy that was produced in association with 20th Century Fox \n\nTelevision for CBS. It follows a team of doctors and support staff stationed at the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital in Uijeongbu, South Korea, during the Korean War.\nThe series premiered on September 17, 1972, and ended February 28, 1983, with the finale becoming the most-watched television episode in U.S. television history with 105.97 million viewers. \n\nMany of the stories in the early seasons are based on real-life tales told by real MASH surgeons who were interviewed by the production team. Like the movie, the series was as much an allegory about the Vietnam War (still in progress when the show began) as it was about the Korean War.[3] It took a number of minor creative liberties with the actual facts of the Korean War.\n\n\nM*A*S*H - S01E05  - The Moose\n\n       Sergeant Baker arrives at the camp with his Moose. Hawkeye decides to find a way of getting her away from Baker. He tries ordering him to release her, tries buying her, and then resorts to cheating at cards. He releases her but she won't go, so he tries to teach her how to be independent. \n\nWayne Rogers  - Captain John Francis Xavier &quot;Trapper&quot; McIntyre \nAlan Alda Captain - Benjamin Franklin &quot;Hawkeye&quot; Pierce \nLarry Linville - Major Franklin Delano Marion Burns \nLoretta Swit - Major Margaret J. &quot;Hot Lips&quot; Houlihan \nMcLean Stevenson - Lt.
