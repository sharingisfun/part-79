With the help from a friend (Cheryl Hines) -- and a pillow -- \nThea fakes the pregnancy while she figures out what to do next. But in the meantime, her boss gets called out \nof town and his cute brother Nick (Luke Kirby) takes over. Nick launches a new parenting division at the publishing \ncompany, and he wants Thea to be the editor. Suddenly she gets a raise and a promotion. Nick and Thea soon begin \nto become romantically involved. And pretty soon she begins to like her new life a lot to the extent that she begins \nto believe she is pregnant. However, her little sister soon grows frutstrated with the lie and destroyed her \npregnancy pillow, and in haste, Thea grabs a balloon, which pops, and her cover is blown. Soon, Thea learns to \nget herself together and apologizes on a national talk show to Nick and the company, and Nick fogives her and \ntakes her back, and she gets to keep her job. Two years later, Thea is shown going into labor with her and \nNick's child...for real.\n\n\nLindsay Lohan ... Thea Clayhill\nLuke Kirby ... Nick Steinwald\nChris Parnell ...
