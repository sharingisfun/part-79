Bert starts with a template that has different pieces for the forehead, face, eye holes, and more. He merges them into one layer and then traces the parts of Iron Man's head with the pen tool that aren't already a part of the mask.\n\n*** Add texture to mask\nIn a new layer, Bert fills a rectangular selection with a solid colors and applies a filter called Fibers (Render &gt; Fibers) using black and white. He then applies the Crystallize filter, and fades this effect's opacity and changes the mode to Overlay in order to let the Fibers show through more. Add a clipping mask to the texture layer so that the pattern stays within the boundaries of the mask. Bend the corners to conform the texture to the mask by using Warp.\n\n*** Add detail to the face\nWith a soft, large brush, create a new clipped layer and paint over the edges of the mask to create a wider range of tones and shadows.\n\n*** Style the eyes\nTo make eyes, create a new layer underneath the mask and quickly trace a selection of the eye holes - this doesn't have to be very precise. Feather the selection and then apply a radial gradient. Bert uses yellow for the foreground and red as the background. Repeat for the second eye, then add some Inner Shadow and Inner Glow in Layer Styles.\n\n*** Create hair\nTo create hair, use a styled brush and remove the spacing. In other brush effects, apply a Fade to 500 and when you use the brush, it will look like hair. Bert does the brushing free-hand in this example. Use grey as the foreground color and use the hair brush in desired areas on a new layer behind the mask and eyes. Vary the foreground color to add some dimension. Add shadowing with a large, black brush in the areas where the mask would overlap the hair.\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nAll episodes can be streamed at Revision3 (duh!) but they can also be downloaded directly from the Revision3 site (they redirect to fast bitgravity servers) at various resolutions and video formats.
