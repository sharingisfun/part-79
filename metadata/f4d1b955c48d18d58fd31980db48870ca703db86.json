James Dean\t\n\nEagles is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California during the early 1970s. The group chose the name Eagles as a nod to The Byrds (as founding member Bernie Leadon had been in Dillard &amp; Clark with former Byrds singer Gene Clark and in The Flying Burrito Brothers with former Byrds Gram Parsons, Chris Hillman, and Michael Clarke). Comedian Steve Martin records in his autobiography, Born Standing Up, that Frey was very particular that the name was Eagles and not The Eagles. The band played initially as Linda RonstadtÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s backing group.\nWith five #1 singles and six #1 albums, the Eagles were one of the most successful recording artists of the decade. At the end of the 20th century, two of their albums, Eagles: Their Greatest Hits 1971ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1975 and Hotel California, ranked among the 20 best-selling albums according to the Recording Industry Association of America. The best-selling studio album Hotel California is rated as the 37th album in the Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and the band was ranked #75 on the magazine's 2004 list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. They also have the best selling album in the U.S. to date with Eagles: Their Greatest Hits 1971ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1975. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4d1b955c48d18d58fd31980db48870ca703db86","amp;dn":"Eagles+-+The+Legend+of+%281999%29+-+Flac+-+Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4d1b955c48d18d58fd31980db48870ca703db86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,209,185,85,196,141,24,213,143,211,25,128,219,72,135,12,167,3,219,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
