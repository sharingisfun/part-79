The moment is always present in Jack's work -- you feel you are going on a journey and no aspect of it predictable. Climactic points have majestic sweep and some aspect of the magical; like taking a jet airliner through someone else's imagination.&quot; ~ Uncle Dave Lewis\n\nJack Ison (Recollectio) - Real Much [mp3 320]\n\n01 Birthday\n02 Devine\n03 Bone of Limbo\n04 Too Early in Love\n05 Beautiful Things\n06 Verse Ion\n07 Muel\n08 Shows It's Self\n09 A Man on the Cross\n10 The Last Resort\n11 Gap (Curiouser &amp; Curiouser)\n12 Is this Real\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tokyoroserecords.com/Tokyo.html#Jack&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tokyoroserecords.com/Tokyo.html#Jack&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02d59c359debf24ab9f491052ce4ae5de4746857","amp;dn":"Jack+Ison+%28Recollectio%29+-+Real+Much+%5Bmp3+320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02d59c359debf24ab9f491052ce4ae5de4746857","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,213,156,53,157,235,242,74,185,244,145,5,44,228,174,93,228,116,104,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
