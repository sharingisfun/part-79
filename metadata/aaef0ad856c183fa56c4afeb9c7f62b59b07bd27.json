He met lead guitarist Bob Taylor (born Robert Taylor, 6 June 1942, London) in 1959 and he joined the band Taylor was in (The Thunderbirds), recording five singles for the Columbia label, without much success. He then moved to Andrew Loog Oldham's Immediate label and recorded another eleven singles, five of them cover versions of Rolling Stones songs; (&quot;Paint It, Black&quot;, &quot;Think&quot;, &quot;Ride On, Baby&quot;, &quot;(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction&quot;, &quot;Out of Time&quot;). His most successful was &quot;Out of Time&quot; which was number 1 in the UK Singles Chart in 1966. His next four singles were also well received. The most famous was &quot;Handbags and Gladrags&quot; (which was written by Mike d'Abo), later covered by Rod Stewart and more recently by the Stereophonics).\nAs an English R&amp;B star of the early 1960s, Farlowe released one single, &quot;Stormy Monday Blues&quot;, under the pseudonym, 'Little Joe Cook', which helped perpetrate the myth that he was black.\nHis association with jazz rock group Colosseum began in the 1970s, recording a live album and three studio albums Daughter of Time, Bread and Circuses and Tomorrow's Blues (2006).\nFarlowe continues to tour extensively throughout the UK and Europe with band Colosseum, and also with his own band. Farlowe also deals in antiques and has a showroom in Islington. In 1972 he joined Atomic Rooster and is featured on the albums Made in England and Nice and Greasy. He also sang on three tracks from Jimmy Page's Death Wish II soundtrack in 1982, as well as the tracks &quot;Hummingbird&quot;, &quot;Prison Blues&quot; and &quot;Blues Anthem&quot; on Page's 1988 Outrider album.\nIn the beginning, Farlowe was backed by the band 'The Thunderbirds', which featured guitarist Albert Lee and Dave Greenslade, (later with him again in Colosseum), Bugs Waddell (bass), Ian Hague (drums) Bernie Greenwood (sax) and Jerry Temple (percussion).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaef0ad856c183fa56c4afeb9c7f62b59b07bd27","amp;dn":"Chris+Farlowe+album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaef0ad856c183fa56c4afeb9c7f62b59b07bd27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,239,10,216,86,193,131,250,86,196,175,235,156,127,98,181,155,7,189,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
