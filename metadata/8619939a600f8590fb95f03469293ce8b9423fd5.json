When one of his former colleagues is murdered, the washed up but no less determined masked vigilante Rorschach sets out to uncover a plot to kill and discredit all past and present superheroes. As he reconnects with his former crime-fighting legion - a ragtag group of retired superheroes, only one of whom has true powers - Rorschach glimpses a wide-ranging and disturbing conspiracy with links to their shared past and catastrophic consequences for the future. Their mission is to watch over humanity ... but who is watching the Watchmen?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonally, I didn't really like this film all that much.  I honestly thought that the over-the-top nudity and sex scene just ruined what would have been a good movie.  Instead of a thrilling tale about how close the world can come to nuclear armageddon in a world where comic book heroes are a dime a dozen and not as glossy as you might think ... instead, the film became whorish.  At least in my personal opinion.  Check it out for yourself and decide.  I would probably have never uploaded this film, but it was requested, and since I had nothing planned, I went ahead and uploaded it.  If you haven't seen it, it's at least worth watching once.  Some people really liked it, others didn't ... either way, you can easily enjoy it at the cost of &quot;FREE&quot; :D\n\n\nHonestly, I didn't know any trivia for this film, so I looked a few up and put down the ones that [b]I[/b] found interesting:\n - This film is based on a graphic novel by the same author as &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; (a film I actually [b]DO[/b] like).\n - When Paul Greengrass was set to direct, he planned to cast Hilary Swank as Silk Spectre and Joaquin Phoenix as Nite Owl. When Greengrass left the project, Swank and Phoenix did as well.\n - Hilary Duff was offered the role of Silk Spectre, but turned down the part. She desired to play the role because she wanted not to be typecast as the &quot;good girl&quot; archetype she developed on the TV series &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot; (WELL, that certainly would have changed the way this film went ... I wonder if they still would have had the racy sex scenes if she'd kept the part!?)\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdditional Info\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike all my iPod torrents, these files have their ID3 tags preformatted for your ease!
