(This does repeat! Discs 1 and 3 have the same Video, while Discs 2 and 4 have the same Video. Each took me hours to customize, but I did it. For you!) Oh, almost forgot! it also has the booklet as a document.dat inside each folder. In game hit home and select Software Manual\n\nHas been tested trough the first save point by myself on phat psp and slim psp with custom firmware 5.50Gen-b2.\n\nTo use: Copy folder with eboot.pbp into the &quot;games&quot; directory of your PSP.\nOnly works with custom firmware or with use with Popstation.\n\nA lot of people experience lagg and freezing with Final Fantasy VIII and IX, if you simply go to the restore panel on your custom firmware PSP (hold down R during boot up with custom firmware) and there should be an option to overclock processor. Overclocking has prevented nearly all lagg and freezing FOR ME.\n\nPlease comment if you enjoy my torrent, I have many pSX games that I've converted for myself that I can post, or if you have any requests.\n\n(If anyone wants this as 1 file, I have it also, just don't want to upload without a demand)\n\nIf anyone has any problems with the game, or if you want to request a game for upload, you can E-Mail me at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;e8818985859a8e9a898683a88f85898184c68b8785&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \n\nMore of my torrents can be found at:\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/iammrfrank\n\n(um.. One other thing.. this torrent says it has 0 seeds and like 1 leecher, and everything I check it, it looks about the same, but in reality it has quite a few seeds and a few leechers also. I don't know why Thepiratebay doesn't see this.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a277f3adb2221d4e22f83bd805ca8457c1a5dfdd","amp;dn":"Final+Frantasy+IX+%28PSX-%3EPSP%29+%5BIammrfrank%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a277f3adb2221d4e22f83bd805ca8457c1a5dfdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,119,243,173,178,34,29,78,34,248,59,216,5,202,132,87,193,165,223,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
