The series follows the life of Melinda Gordon (Jennifer Love Hewitt), who has the ability to see and communicate with the dead. While trying to live as normal a life as possible, Melinda helps them pass over to the other side by working as a paranormal investigator, sometimes dealing with people who push her away, and disbelieve her ability. Ghost Whisperer airs Friday nights at 8/7c on CBS. The show was created by John Gray and is produced by Sander/Moses Productions, in association with ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios. Ghost Whisperer is a series that follows the life of Melinda Gordon, a young woman from the fictional town of Grandview who has the ability to see and communicate with the dead. Melinda lives with her husband Jim, and is the owner of an antique shop. Ghosts seek Melinda's help in relaying a message or completing a task that will put the spirit to rest, and allow them to cross over into The Light, a metaphor presented by the show as its conception of Heaven.
