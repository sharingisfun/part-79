I have them both so I' can't complain.\n(I'll be getting to that DVD release shortly)\nBoth the VHS &amp; Laser Disc contain the original videos as released. It's my understanding besides video quality.\nthe VHS was MONO and the Laser Disc STEREO.\nPersonally I like parts of both ...so it's almost impossible to choose between the two if one had too.\n\nThe track list is:\n01. Intro / Give Peace A Chance (5:28)\n02. Cold Turkey (5:23)\n03. Instant Karma (3:33)\n04. Power To The People (3:20)\n05. Happy Xmas (War Is Over) (3:41)\n06. Mind Games (4:18)\n07. Whatever Gets You Thru The Night (3:33)\n08. No. 9 Dream (4:49)\n09. Stand By Me (3:54)\n10. Slippin' And Slidin' (2:31)\n11. Imagine (3:32)\n12. (Just Like) Starting Over (4:03)\n13. Woman (3:43)\n14. Nobody Told Me (3:47)\n15. Borrowed Time (4:43)\n16. I'm Steppin' Out (4:10)\n17. Jealous Guy (4:29)\n18. Grow Old With Me (3:14)\n19. Imagine (Live) (3:16)\n20.
