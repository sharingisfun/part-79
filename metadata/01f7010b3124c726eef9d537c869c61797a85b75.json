Carolyn is a real estate agent, a little too wrapped up in her job, who takes on an affair with business rival Buddy Kane. Meanwhile Jane seems to fall in love with Ricky Fitts, the strange boy next door, who is a drug dealer/documentarian and lives under a roof governed by a very strict marine father and a speechless mother. Lester's mid-life crisis causes him to drastically change his life around when he quits his job and works at a fast food restaurant. He starts working out to gain the attention of Angela, a friend of Jane's, who brags about her sexual exploits every weekend. Lives change and not for the best.  \n\n\nIMDB Info - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169547/\n\n\nSame as always - Comment, seed and enjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01f7010b3124c726eef9d537c869c61797a85b75","amp;dn":"American+Beauty+%281999%29+-+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01f7010b3124c726eef9d537c869c61797a85b75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,247,1,11,49,36,199,38,238,249,213,55,200,105,198,23,151,168,91,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
