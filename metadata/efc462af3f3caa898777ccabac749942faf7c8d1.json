It is the elimination of personal freedom under the banner of sustainable development. UN control of your sovereignty.\n\nMichael Shaw, an ecologist and founding member of Freedom 21 Santa Cruz, shows how the concepts behind sustainable development are incompatible with personal liberty.\n\nMichael Coffman, President of Environmental Perspectives, reveals the false assumptions and outright fraud in sustainable development proposals. Michael Chapman, of the American Heritage Research Group, makes a breathtaking presentation on how American schoolchildren have been conditioned to uncritically accept the premises of sustainable development as part of a larger plan to prepare them for global citizenship.\n\nBeverly Eakman, author of Cloning of the American Mind, exposes the group-manipulation tactics used in schools and public meetings to alter the attitudes of unwary participants.\n\nTom DeWeese, President of the American Policy Center, summarizes and focuses the issues in terms of what must be done if freedom is to survive. This 6-hour seminar is loaded with information you can use to help others see through the environmental smokescreen called sustainable development. It is ideal for group presentations, either as a series of 90-minute programs or a one-day seminar. There are 3 DVDs in this set.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freedom21.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freedom21.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.epi-us.com/store-products-liberty-Americas-Choice:-Liberty-or-Sustainable-Development_40753898.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.epi-us.com/store-products-liberty-Americas-Choice:-Liberty-or-Sustainable-Development_40753898.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n  ____                      _                      _   _       _\n / ___|___  _ __  ___ _ __ (_)_ __ __ _  ___ _   _| | | |_   _| |__\n| |   / _ \\| '_ \\/ __| '_ \\| | '__/ _` |/ __| | | | |_| | | | | '_ \\\n| |__| (_) | | | \\__ \\ |_) | | | | (_| | (__| |_| |  _  | |_| | |_) |\n \\____\\___/|_| |_|___/ .__/|_|_|  \\__,_|\\___|\\__, |_| |_|\\__,_|_.__/\n                     |_|                     |___/\n   ____\n  / ___|___  _ __ ___\n | |   / _ \\| '_ ` _ \\\n | |__| (_) | | | | | |\n(_)____\\___/|_| |_| |_|\n\n\nPLEASE KEEP SEEDED.
