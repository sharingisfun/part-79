Just some hints and ideas, all improvisations on a Roland synthesizer. All more or less relaxing, new age like music. As a jazz impro pianist he couldnÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´t help putting in a blue note here and there. I hear a future soundtrack now and then.\n\nAnyway, I thought it would be a good idea to share his music with other people, so feel free to download without having an uneasy conscience, since thereÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s no copyright on the tracks. \n\nLeave your comments and requests down below here. He might make a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfull albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in the style of one of the tracks that people like most.\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e0e43274de0f439ece660fb8f97f44df39ba0f5","amp;dn":"Paul+improvises+for+you%3A+leave+your+comment","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e0e43274de0f439ece660fb8f97f44df39ba0f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,14,67,39,77,224,244,57,236,230,96,251,143,151,244,77,243,155,160,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
