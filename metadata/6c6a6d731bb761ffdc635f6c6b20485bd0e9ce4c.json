We only know what little that Jack and his wife Teri are able to piece together while looking for her.\n    * ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Cut nearly all scenes of Teri Bauer looking for Kim, now we just get periodic updates when she talks on the phone with Jack.\n    * ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Cut all scenes from the perspective of the bad guys, now we find things out along with Jack and the team at CTU.\n    * ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Cut some of the office bickering and annoyances with Tony, Nina, Jamie, and Mason.\n    * ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Numerous small cuts to remove annoyances, improve pacing, and make things more consistent.\n\n\nWhat I present to you is a three part series of everything that makes 24 great, minus over 8 hours of cut scenes that I assure you won't be missed, and actually were kind of awful.\n\nThis first movie is created from episodes 1 - 8, and is 2 hours and 15 minutes long (201 minutes cut).\n\nXVID movie\n624 x 352 resolution\nLame MP3 192 kbps audio\n\nPart 2 will be released for sure by the end of December, and Part 3 will follow a month or two after (they are both nearly finished).\n\nPlease visit fanedit.org to learn more about fan edits and see many great projects other editors have done.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c6a6d731bb761ffdc635f6c6b20485bd0e9ce4c","amp;dn":"24+Refocused+-+a+Fan-Edit+movie+made+from+the+1st+Season","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c6a6d731bb761ffdc635f6c6b20485bd0e9ce4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,106,109,115,27,183,97,255,220,99,95,108,107,32,72,91,208,233,206,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
