The theory posits that all psi &amp; paranormal phenomena come from the same source or field. This field also incorporates time shifts-- &quot;an astounding phenomenon in which our perceived reality and the timelines are just constantly being restructured,&quot; she said. Alternate versions of the timeline can coexist in different frequencies, and time slips occur when people become aware of odd changes, such as being sure that a certain person is dead, only to find out they're alive, she explained.\n\nWhitley &amp; Anne Strieber joined Starfire for a segment to discuss an unusual time slip episode they had when first meeting her. The Striebers and Starfire Tor will be giving presentations along with William Henry at the upcoming Dreamland Stargate Experience at Joshua Tree in October.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the latter half of the show, paranormal expert Brad Steiger discussed real vampires, stalkers and creatures of the dark. While the legend of the vampire has been made into something glamorous and seductive by Hollywood, the reality is much harsher and uglier, he noted. Vampiric lore dates all the way back to Lilith, a demon written about in early Jewish texts, who was associated with succubi and incubi. The ancient Jews used skulls and magic to drive away the sons and daughters of Lilith, he detailed.\n\nReal life vampires, as opposed to members of the modern day vampire subculture, can commit heinous acts of violence and horror. Steiger suggested that some of these individuals may be possessed by evil parasitic spirit entities that feed on them, and control their behavior. Various vices and addictions can act as an invitation for these beings to come through, he cautioned.\n\n\nSteiger also mentioned a connection to vampirism and UFOs-- in South America, numerous witnesses describe the UFO occupants as vampire-like entities. The chupacabras, he added, may be an animal that is possessed by one of the parasitic forces.\nAlex Jones Update\nFirst half-hour guest, radio host Alex Jones commented on misunderstandings regarding a fictitious Charlie Sheen/Pres. Obama interview posted on his site.\n\nWebsite(s):\nunknowncountry.com\nstarfiretor.com\nbradandsherry.com\n\nBook(s):\nCritical Mass\nReal Vampires, Night Stalkers and Creatures from the Darkside\n2012: The War for Souls\nOtherworldly Affaires\nShadow World: True Encounters with Beings from the Darkside\n\n\n\nbrought to you by:\n                                                \n .d8888b.                                                      888    \nd88P  Y88b                                                     888    \n888    888                                                     888    \n888    888 888  888  .d88b.  888d888 .d8888b  8888b.  .d8888b  888888 \n888    888 888  888 d8P  Y8b 888P&quot;  d88P&quot;        &quot;88b 88K      888    \n888    888 Y88  88P 88888888 888    888      .d888888 &quot;Y8888b. 888    \nY88b  d88P  Y8bd8P  Y8b.     888    Y88b.    888  888      X88 Y88b.  \n &quot;Y8888P&quot;    Y88P    &quot;Y8888  888     &quot;Y8888P &quot;Y888888  88888P'  &quot;Y888 \n\nTorrents: http://thepiratebay.se/user/0vercast/\nRSS: http://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/2eb7e342dacfa8938e79732ad03e1224","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a8a6dbe9c1f9a670e2658c40280b7735e426bcc","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+AM+-+Sep+09+2009+-+Real+Vampires+and+Time+Shifts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a8a6dbe9c1f9a670e2658c40280b7735e426bcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,138,109,190,156,31,154,103,14,38,88,196,2,128,183,115,94,66,107,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
