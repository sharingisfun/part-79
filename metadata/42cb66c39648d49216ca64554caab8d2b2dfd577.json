This album is extremely rare and hard to find. It's as is AS Sekiria and Akira Sudou dropped off the face of the earth, partially I believe because the Meldac label went under. This was released shortly after they did the music for the Anime Bubblegum Crisis: Tokyo 2040. This album is great hard rock. Surprising they didn't take off. \n\nAS SEKIRIA - NO OBLIGATION\n\n1. Give and Take\n2. Another Face\n3. Anata no Umi\n4. Jealousy\n5. Make a Motion\n6.
