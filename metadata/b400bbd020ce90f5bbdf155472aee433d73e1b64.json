The book is an autobiographical account of her experience as a Marine who left her career to become a teacher at a well-off high school attended by bussed-in students from a ghetto. The film, starring Michelle Pfeiffer, focuses on the challenges of growing up in the city of East Palo Alto, California and of the efforts of a dedicated teacher to allow her class to learn basic elementary education.\n\nWhen a retired U.S. Marine, LouAnne Johnson (Michelle Pfeiffer), arrives at Parkmont High School (Carlmont High School, Belmont, CA) with poor, angry minorities from East Palo Alto, California, she finds a class of tough, street-wise kids, involved in gangs and drugs, whom Johnson quickly dubs the &quot;rejects from hell.&quot; Her initially meek demeanor, small stature, and white skin earn her the nickname &quot;white bread&quot; from her students. Determined to have them trust and respect her, she quickly changes her presentation, wearing leather jackets, teaching karate to her students and cursing in the classroom. Creating her own curriculum for her &quot;socially challenged&quot; and extremely antagonistic class, she starts having them read poetry, using Bob Dylan lyrics to teach symbolism. Johnson rewards her students for their hard work by giving them candy bars to say good job, toy prizes and trip to a boardwalk theme park. Along with helping her students with school work, she also provides emotional support to several students, including a couple of wise-cracking boys who are too caught up in street politics for their own good, and a teen who's dealing with the reality of being pregnant in high school. Although she intends to leave at the end of the year, the students quote the lyrics of a Dylan Thomas poem that they learned and insist that she's their &quot;light&quot; and refuse to let her leave. Touched, she agrees to stay\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112792/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112792/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPLEASE SEED AND ENJOY","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b400bbd020ce90f5bbdf155472aee433d73e1b64","amp;dn":"DANGEROUS-MINDS...DVDrip%5Bvice%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b400bbd020ce90f5bbdf155472aee433d73e1b64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,0,187,208,32,206,144,245,187,223,21,84,114,174,228,51,215,62,27,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
