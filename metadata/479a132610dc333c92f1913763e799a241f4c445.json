The task is to become the victor, as with most RTS'. Multiplayer doesn't work with this version, and there's nothing I can do to fix it, sorry.\n\n\nDirections:\n-The torrent will automatically deposit the 'Multiwinia' folder to wherever you set as the completed directory. There's no zips.\n-After it's there, and completed, just click, 'multiwinia.exe'. It'll start up the game. At the beginning, there'll be a serial code screen, just click 'Enter'. \n-That's it! You're done!\n\nHave fun, and don't forget to seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:479a132610dc333c92f1913763e799a241f4c445","amp;dn":"Multiwinia+-+Reloaded+-+Samanoskeake","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"479a132610dc333c92f1913763e799a241f4c445","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,154,19,38,16,220,51,60,146,241,145,55,99,231,153,162,65,244,196,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
