As more of the giant robots continue to resurface, though, it becomes apparent the Transformers have been part of Earth's history for longer than they'd led mankind to believe. One group of bureaucrats even [wonders] if the Decepticons are only appearing because of the Autobot presence. Desperate not to leave Earth undefended, Optimus Prime turns to Sam and asks him to become a human advocate, someone who will convince mankind that the Autobots should be allowed to [stay]. Sam refuses to believe he can help, though, wanting to go to college and live a normal life - as normal as possible with the strange thoughts and visions that have haunted him since being exposed to the All Spark's primal energies two years earlier. Alas, Sam's refusal will have harsh consequences for himself, the Autobots and possibly the entire world. The Decepticons fallen leader, Megatron has been resurrected and brings with him an ancient evil from the Transformers own history","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:991ce69b045a8cfb89d3f8b90b040b6e1f36a848","amp;dn":"Transformers%3A+Revenge+of+the+Fallen%2F2009%2Fen%2Fes%2Ffr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"991ce69b045a8cfb89d3f8b90b040b6e1f36a848","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,28,230,155,4,90,140,251,137,211,248,185,11,4,11,110,31,54,168,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
