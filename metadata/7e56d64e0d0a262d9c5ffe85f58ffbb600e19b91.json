SeaTools for DOS can test Seagate or Maxtor Parallel ATA (PATA and IDE) and Serial ATA (SATA) interface disc drives. Because the software boots to its own operating system you can test your drive regardless of the OS installed on it.  You can even test a new or completely blank drive.  SeaTools for DOS will instruct the drive to run its built in Drive Self Test (DST) and give either a pass or fail status.  If you are troubleshooting your disc drive and the DST passes, then you have a good drive!\n\n\nSystem Requirements\n-------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; at least one (1) disc drive. Seagate Technology disc drives will support enhanced features.\n&gt;&gt; an IBM / Intel compatible PC with a 386 or greater processor.\n&gt;&gt; SVGA 800 x 600 or greater graphics capability.\n&gt;&gt; at least 8 megabytes of RAM.\n&gt;&gt; CD-ROM drive for the bootable SeaTools application.\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nInstallation note:\n-------------------------------------------------\n1. Burning the .ISO file to a CD. (Just copying the files to a CD will not work; the file must be burned as an image to the CD.)\n2. Boot your computer from CD\n3. Enjoy\n------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e56d64e0d0a262d9c5ffe85f58ffbb600e19b91","amp;dn":"SeaTools+for+DOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e56d64e0d0a262d9c5ffe85f58ffbb600e19b91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,86,214,78,13,10,38,45,156,95,254,133,245,143,251,182,0,225,155,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
