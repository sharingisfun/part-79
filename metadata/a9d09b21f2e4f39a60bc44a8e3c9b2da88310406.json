To install, do the following:\n\n1. Copy the .deb file to your iPod using OpenSSH (google it, if you don't know how). Put it in /var/mobile/, and change permissions to '777'.\n\n2. Open Mobile Terminal (can be downloaded from Cydia). Type &quot;su&quot; (without &quot;). Then you need to enter your password, that is &quot;alpine&quot; (again, without &quot;). \n\n\n3. Now, you should be in the same map as the .deb file. Type exactly &quot;dpkg -i gpSPhone 6.1.0.deb&quot;.\n\n4. Reboot, and it should work. \n\n\n\nReply if something fails.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9d09b21f2e4f39a60bc44a8e3c9b2da88310406","amp;dn":"gpSPhone+6.1.0.deb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9d09b21f2e4f39a60bc44a8e3c9b2da88310406","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,208,155,33,242,228,243,154,96,188,68,168,227,201,178,218,136,49,4,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
