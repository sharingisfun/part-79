Commonly thought of as computer criminals and vandals,\na true hacker is an innovative thinker able to &quot;hack&quot; himself out of a given\nproblem or situation, whether it be computer related or not. Historically,\nhackers have accounted for mankind's greatest inventions and discoveries and\nyet have repeatedly been persecuted for their new ideas by the powerful and\nfearful. Experts on cyber-terrorism also examine our societal view of the hacker\nand debate as to whether or not we should recruit and utilize the skills of the\nhelpful hackers to fight future cyber-wars, instead of continuing to punish what\nwe do not understand. - Sam Bozzo\n\nTitle       Hackers Wanted\nAKA         Can You Hack It?\n            Untitled Hacker Documentary: The 'Homeless' Hacker Adrian Lamo\nDirection   Sam Bozzo\nWritting    Sam Bozzo\nProduction  Kevin Spacey\n            Dana Brunetti\n            Trigger Street Productions\nNarration   Kevin Spacey\nLength      87 minutes\n\nFeaturing   Adrian Lamo\n            Kevin Spacey\n            Leo Laporte\n            Steve Wozniak\n            Peter Shipley\n            Kevin Rose\n            Dorothy Dennings\n            Craig Calef\n            Robert Lyttle\n            John Draper\n            Richard Feynman\n            John Arquilla\n            Kevin Lee Poulsen\n\nIMDb        Deleted\n            Archived at http://web.archive.org/web/20071018064053/www.imdb.com/title/tt0816690/\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c08e0da4a8875a923bbba406e0c6aa9961e984f","amp;dn":"Hackers.Wanted.2008.XviD%5Bmicro%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c08e0da4a8875a923bbba406e0c6aa9961e984f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,8,224,218,74,136,117,169,35,187,186,64,110,12,106,169,150,30,152,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
