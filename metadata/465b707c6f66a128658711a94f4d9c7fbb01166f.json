Created in 50 AD, the wood panels of the Loculus are emblazoned with two images: the Ankh symbol - a looped crucifix - and the Caduceus - a rod entwined with two serpents. On its perilous journey through history, the Loculus was further adorned with more arcane mystical imagery including pentagrams, hexagrams, a crucified serpent, the naked human form divine and a hermaphrodite. And many have tried to unlock the secret of the sacred artefact - a secret only a chosen few know contains profound and overwhelming ramifications for mankind. In 1299 a Jewish alchemist's attempts to unravel the enigma ended in disaster. And in 1710 Sir Isaac Newton, discoverer of the laws of gravity and a foremost member of the Masonic Order of the Knights Templar, also strove to answer the riddle. But with the art of science in its infancy, Newton realised the Underground Stream of research needed to solve the puzzle would have to flow for several more centuries before the prophesied ultimate Great Work could be wrought in all its glory. Now, the Loculus, missing for hundreds of years, has reappeared again... Revelation tells the story of the final search for the Loculus and its effect on the Martel family and the whole world\n\n[IMG]http://i203.photobucket.com/albums/aa38/476352oop/MOVIES/REVCP.jpg[/IMG]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278675/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278675/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[IMG]http://i203.photobucket.com/albums/aa38/476352oop/MOVIES/REV1.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i203.photobucket.com/albums/aa38/476352oop/MOVIES/REV2.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i203.photobucket.com/albums/aa38/476352oop/MOVIES/REV3.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i203.photobucket.com/albums/aa38/476352oop/MOVIES/REV4.jpg[/IMG]\n\nTrailer_ http://www.imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi2542797081/\n\nFormat :      AVI\nFormat/Info :     Audio Video Interleave\nFile size :     897 MiB\nDuration :     1h 50mn\nOverall bit rate :     1 130 Kbps\nWriting application :     VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nWriting library :     VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\nVideo\nFormat :     MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile :     Streaming Video@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP :     Yes\nFormat settings, QPel :     No\nFormat settings, GMC :     No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix :     Custom\nCodec ID :     XVID\nCodec ID/Hint :     XviD\nDuration :     1h 50mn\n\nAudio\nFormat :     AC-3\nFormat/Info :     Audio Coding 3\nCodec ID :     2000\nDuration :     1h 50mn\nBit rate mode :     Constant\nBit rate :     192 Kbps\nChannel(s) :     2 channels\nChannel positions :     L R\n\nGeneral\nComplete name : REVELATION.DEWSTRRREV 1.sfv\nFile size :     844 Bytes\n\nGeneral\nComplete name : REVELATION.DEWSTRRREVELATION.NFO\nFile size :     1.89 KiB\n\nYOU CAN BURN THIS MOVIE AND A COUPLE MORE ON A DISK AND WATCH ON A DIVX DVD PLAYER, OR USE THE USB PORT WITH A EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE  \nSET ASPECT RATIO [4:3,OR 16:9] FOR MAXIMUM SIZE, LCD TV- VERTICAL SIZE IT,\nNO NEED TO CONVERT TO DVD FORMAT\n\nlink to the screen shots if you want\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s203.photobucket.com/albums/aa38/476352oop/MOVIES/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s203.photobucket.com/albums/aa38/476352oop/MOVIES/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:465b707c6f66a128658711a94f4d9c7fbb01166f","amp;dn":"REVELATION.DEWSTRR%2FDVDRIP_Thriller%2CHorror%2CAdventure","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"465b707c6f66a128658711a94f4d9c7fbb01166f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,91,112,124,111,102,161,40,101,135,17,169,79,77,156,127,187,1,22,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
