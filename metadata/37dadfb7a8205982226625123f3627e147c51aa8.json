This should bypass the 'Insert DVD Error'.\n\nNo serial is required.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37dadfb7a8205982226625123f3627e147c51aa8","amp;dn":"Age+Of+Empires+COLLECTION+%283+cds%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37dadfb7a8205982226625123f3627e147c51aa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,218,223,183,168,32,89,130,34,102,37,18,63,54,39,225,71,197,26,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
