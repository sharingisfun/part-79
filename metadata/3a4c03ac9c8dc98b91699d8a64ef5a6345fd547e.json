Cant wait for ya to get back in action. :D Continuing the legacy of great quality, KiNGDOM releases... ;)  I know, I know. &quot;A v3. WTF?&quot; :lol: I wasnt all here when I did v1 and v2 v1 I had blew it on the AR v2 I blew it on the colors. I was trying to stay up to late to do it. I payed for it at work today on 2 hrs of sleep. Now onto the release, I used the XViDS like everyone else has on the 2 previous releases, but on this one I used the Source DVD. I think it is much better this time around this one has the original ac3 256kb/s audio. Correct AR and upped the bitrate quite abit. I think its generally better. I did not blur the subs on this one , but I am going to do 2 of these 1 blurred and one not. TAKE IT or LEAVE IT. ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a4c03ac9c8dc98b91699d8a64ef5a6345fd547e","amp;dn":"Grown+Ups+2010+DVDSCR+v3+READNFO+XViD-KiNGDOM+%28Kingdom-Release%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a4c03ac9c8dc98b91699d8a64ef5a6345fd547e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,76,3,172,156,141,201,139,145,105,157,138,100,239,90,99,69,253,84,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
