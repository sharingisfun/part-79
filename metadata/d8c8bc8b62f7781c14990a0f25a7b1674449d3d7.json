Larry prepared a short announcement to use on Distrowatch:\n\nPuppy 5.0, code named &quot;Lupu&quot; and also referred to as &quot;Lucid Puppy&quot; as it is built from Ubuntu Lucid Lynx binary packages, is now available. It is typically Puppy, lean and fast, friendly and fun, with some new features. Puppy 5.0 features Quickpet, with some of the best Linux productivity and entertainment programs, configured and tested, available with one-click. Puppy 5 also introduces choice in browsers: pick one or all and choose the default. Lupu boots directly to the desktop and has tools easily at hand to personalize Puppy, if they are needed. Language and Locale are easy to set. KaulerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Simple Network Setup is another of those easy config tools. Updating to keep up with bugfixes is another one-click wonder. Previous Puppies were all prepared primarily by Kauler but Puppy 5.0 was a product of the Puppy community with Mick Amadio, chief developer, and Larry Short, coordinator.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8c8bc8b62f7781c14990a0f25a7b1674449d3d7","amp;dn":"Puppy+Linux+5.0+%28Lucid+Puppy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8c8bc8b62f7781c14990a0f25a7b1674449d3d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,200,188,139,98,247,120,28,20,153,10,15,37,167,177,103,68,73,211,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
