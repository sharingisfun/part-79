Jones and E.J. Waggoner. The Seventh-day Adventist church rejected the message despite it's endorsement by prominent leaders such as Ellen G. White. \n\n1888 Gold discusses the primary thrust of this message; that through Christ, the born-again believer need never, and most forcefully will never, commit known sin. The book makes it's case through both Scripture and early Adventist writings, citing verses such as 1 John 3:9: &quot;Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin, for His seed remaineth in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62bab2721d908becc6bb4fecc1e34d60daa4f7c7","amp;dn":"1888+Gold+-+Walter+%5C%22Chick%5C%22+McGill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62bab2721d908becc6bb4fecc1e34d60daa4f7c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,186,178,114,29,144,139,236,198,187,79,236,193,227,77,96,218,164,247,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
