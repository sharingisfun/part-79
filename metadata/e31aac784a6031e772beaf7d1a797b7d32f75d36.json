In hour one, financial advisor Joe Meyer provided an update on the current economic meltdown. Then, Art spoke with paranormal investigator Dr. Stephen Rorke about Spiricom and Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) during the second hour. The final two hours were a replay from 10/5/03, featuring Richard C. Hoagland and Mike Heiser.\n\nArt will continue his interview with Dr. Rorke on October 23, 2009. They will be discussing the work of the late Ralph Rene, who wrote extensively about the lunar-landing hoax theory.\n\nWebsite(s):\nspiricomstudy.com\nstraightmoneyanalysis.com\n\n\n\nbrought to you by:\n                                                \n .d8888b.                                                      888    \nd88P  Y88b                                                     888    \n888    888                                                     888    \n888    888 888  888  .d88b.  888d888 .d8888b  8888b.  .d8888b  888888 \n888    888 888  888 d8P  Y8b 888P&quot;  d88P&quot;        &quot;88b 88K      888    \n888    888 Y88  88P 88888888 888    888      .d888888 &quot;Y8888b. 888    \nY88b  d88P  Y8bd8P  Y8b.     888    Y88b.    888  888      X88 Y88b.  \n &quot;Y8888P&quot;    Y88P    &quot;Y8888  888     &quot;Y8888P &quot;Y888888  88888P'  &quot;Y888 \n\nTorrents: http://thepiratebay.se/user/0vercast/\nRSS: http://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/2eb7e342dacfa8938e79732ad03e1224","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e31aac784a6031e772beaf7d1a797b7d32f75d36","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+AM+-+Sep+25+2009+-+Spiricom%2C+EVP%2C+%26+Moon+Hoax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e31aac784a6031e772beaf7d1a797b7d32f75d36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,26,172,120,74,96,49,231,114,190,175,125,26,121,123,125,50,247,93,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
