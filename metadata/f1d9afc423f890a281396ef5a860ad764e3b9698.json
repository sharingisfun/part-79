I doubt that there are any though.\n\n\n     And now, the fun part: for you guitar geeks (like myself), here's an easy-to-learn tab for &quot;A Hero Comes Home&quot; (in case you seem to have lost your lyre):\n\n\n     E:--------3-----------3-----------------------------------------------|\n     B:------3---3-------3---3-------3-----------1-----------------------1-|\n     G:----3-------3---3-------3---3-------3---2-------2-----2-----3---2---|\n     D:--5-----------5-----------5-------5---3-------3-----3-----5---3---- |\n     A:--------------------------------6-----------5-----5-----6-----------|\n     E:--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n\n     (repeat from the beginning, this goes trough the whole song - listen and play)\n\n     Thanks to anyone who wrote this tab!\n\n\n     And thank you for downloading and seeding!\n\n\n     OK, what's left now...\n\n\n     Oh yes! Hi to you people! :)                   HajrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ magyarok! ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1d9afc423f890a281396ef5a860ad764e3b9698","amp;dn":"Beowulf+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1d9afc423f890a281396ef5a860ad764e3b9698","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,217,175,196,35,248,144,162,129,57,110,245,168,96,173,118,78,59,150,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
