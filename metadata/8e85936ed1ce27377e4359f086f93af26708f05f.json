Humans waited for the hostile attack, or the giant advances in technology. Neither came. Instead, the aliens were refugees, the last survivors of their home world. The creatures were set up in a makeshift home in South AfricaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s District 9 as the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nations argued over what to do with them.\n\nNow, patience over the alien situation has run out. Control over the aliens has been contracted out to Multi-National United (MNU), a private company uninterested in the aliensÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ welfare ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ they will receive tremendous profits if they can make the aliensÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ awesome weaponry work. So far, they have failed; activation of the weaponry requires alien DNA. The tension between the aliens and the humans comes to a head.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://moviefox.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://moviefox.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVideo and Audio is improvement on previous releases enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e85936ed1ce27377e4359f086f93af26708f05f","amp;dn":"District.9.2009.R5.XviD-ViSiON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e85936ed1ce27377e4359f086f93af26708f05f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,133,147,110,209,206,39,55,126,67,89,240,134,249,58,242,103,8,240,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
