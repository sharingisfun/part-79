If I am missing any recordings, please let me know. I am pretty sure that this is all of them.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the work of Download, check out their wiki: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Download_%28band%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Download_%28band%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDownload is an electronic music group formed by Dwayne Goettel and cEvin Key of Skinny Puppy during 1994. The initial lineup also included Off &amp; Gone's Phil Western and Mark Spybey of Dead Voices On Air, but has since been particularly fluid, with Key and Western being the only constant members after Goettel's death. Download's music has been described as post-industrial, drawing from the band's genesis as part of Skinny Puppy but also sharing common stylistic ground with such artists as Aphex Twin and Autechre. The primary instrumentation common throughout their albums is a blend of synthesizers and sampled instruments; the music is particularly centered on elements of percussion and rhythm.\n\nOther artists that have been involved are Genesis P. Orridge, Anthony Valcic, Bill Van Rooy, and Ken Marshall. Earlier releases frequently included vocal elements and lyrics, but since III (and Mark Spybey's departure in 1996) their work has been strictly instrumental.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf0fbc87eaa0ea96641e4eca2f2546514697b731","amp;dn":"Download+-+Discography+%5B1994-2007%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf0fbc87eaa0ea96641e4eca2f2546514697b731","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,15,188,135,234,160,234,150,100,30,78,202,47,37,70,81,70,151,183,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
