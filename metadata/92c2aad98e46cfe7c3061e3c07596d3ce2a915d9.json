Her ghost is invisible and trapped in the school, but her best friend Kang Sun-min, who broadcast in the lunchtime in school, is able to hear her voice. After the suicide of their music teacher, Sun-min, aided by her mate Cho-Ah, finds that another student, Hyo-Jung, died in the same elevator trunk some time ago. Meanwhile Young-Eon recalls details of her life, disclosing why she died.\n\nIn a girls' school where music plays that only certain people can hear - along a quiet corridor or after hours, when the building is deserted - the death of a student singer sets in motion one of the eeriest, most dramatic, and most thoroughly absorbing films to come out of South Korea yet.\n\nRun Time: 104 minutes\nLanguage: Korean\nSubtitles: English Hard Subbed\n\ncredit Infectious (JDPennington) BIG BIG BIG TIME &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92c2aad98e46cfe7c3061e3c07596d3ce2a915d9","amp;dn":"Voice+DVDRip+XviD+LKRG+%26+JDPennington%28ENG+SUBS%29%5BExtraTorrent%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92c2aad98e46cfe7c3061e3c07596d3ce2a915d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,194,170,217,142,70,207,231,195,6,30,60,7,89,109,60,226,169,21,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
