The band first came into the national spotlight with their debut album Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich, and one of its singles, &quot;Heaven,&quot; reached #2 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nDirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich is the debut studio album by American glam metal band Warrant, released in 1989.\n\nThe album was highly successful, spawning the hit singles &quot;Heaven&quot; (#2, 1989), &quot;Down Boys&quot; (#27, 1989) and &quot;Sometimes She Cries&quot; (#20, 1990).\n\nThe album was released amidst some controversy. It was widely rumored that guitarists Erik Turner and Joey Allen had not played a note on the album and that all guitar work had been performed by ex Streets guitarist and session musician Mike Slamer. While the rumor has never been verified, Slamer's wife confirmed in 1998 that her husband played guitar on the record.\n\nDuring the recording of the album, vocalist Jani Lane walked in on his best friend in bed with his girlfriend, leading to his nervous breakdown. The album was recorded without Lane's vocals, and its release was delayed by several months while Lane recovered. These events would later be recounted in the single &quot;I Saw Red&quot; on the band's following album, Cherry Pie. \n\nThe record was produced and engineered by Beau Hill, who also contributed keyboards and backing vocals. It was recorded at The Enterprise in Burbank, California.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2537c9ce77c305bbe85c62c2ce795f10f299f508","amp;dn":"Warrant+-+Big+Talk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2537c9ce77c305bbe85c62c2ce795f10f299f508","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,55,201,206,119,195,5,187,232,92,98,194,206,121,95,16,242,153,245,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
