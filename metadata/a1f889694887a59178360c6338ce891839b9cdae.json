Escaping, Leopold hides out in the home of his childhood sweetheart Nora Shelley ...which she has just rented to unsuspecting law professor Michael Lightcap. As Lightcap's unwelcome guests, Nora and Leopold drag the professor, willy-nilly, from pure legal theory to impure legal practice. Blends comedy, thriller, philosophy, mystery and romance.\n\nWhen accused arsonist Leopold Dilg escapes jail, he hides out in the home of old friend (and sweetheart) Nora. Nora happens to be renting a farmhouse to Supreme Court candidate Michael Lightcap, but she lets Dilg hide in the attic while Lightcap gets settled. The next day, she introduces Dilg as the gardener. In conversation, though, Lightcap realizes that the gardener has a lot to say about the law! Nora and Dilg team up to convince him that Dilg was framed. The three dodge the cops, try to capture the real crooks, and discover that both men have fallen for Nora. Two different endings were filmed, one in which Nora gives her heart to Dilg, the other in which she leaves with Lightcap. Guess which one remains the classic comic conclusion.\n\nActors Cary Grant,Jean Arthur,Ronald Colman\n\nNominated for 7 Oscars\n\nSubtitles Arabic, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish\n\nIt is complete with menu and special features\n\n\n\nEnjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1f889694887a59178360c6338ce891839b9cdae","amp;dn":"The+Talk+Of+The+Town+1942+PAL+Cary+Grant","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1f889694887a59178360c6338ce891839b9cdae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,248,137,105,72,135,165,145,120,54,12,99,56,206,137,24,57,185,205,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
