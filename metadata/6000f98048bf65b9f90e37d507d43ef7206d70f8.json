Description from All Movie Guide:\n\nOn a hot night in August 1969, actress Sharon Tate, Folger's Coffee heiress Abigail Folger, Polish filmmaker Voityck Frykowski, hairdresser Jay Sebring, and Steven Parent were brutally murdered in the sheltered Benedict Canyon. The next night, Rosemary and Leno LaBianca were murdered in their home across town.\n\nThe killers were on the loose and panic gripped Southern Californians until a band of cult members led by ex-con Charles Manson was arrested three months later. The strange ten-month trial that followed held the attention of the entire nation.\n\nThis installment of the Court TV series reveals the events of this horrible crime and features commentary from prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi, co-prosecutor Stephen Kay, and lead defense attorney Paul Fitzgerald.\n~ Linda J.
