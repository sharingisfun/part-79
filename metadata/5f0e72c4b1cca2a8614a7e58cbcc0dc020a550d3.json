Double click on the Reg.reg file...\n\n\nFull HD Video, New Modules, Data Disc Menus\nAshampoo Burning Studio users are unusually loyal, with good reason ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ this programÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s speed, simplicity and efficiency are simply unbeatable. Over the years the Ashampoo programmers have turned the program into a full suite that can handle all your data, audio and video burning and authoring tasks, without sacrificing its famous ease of use. In version 10 they have once again added a wealth of new features and modules, but the program is still amazingly intuitive to use ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ everything is explained as you do it.\n\nThe main focus of this premium version is even better authoring capabilities for building video and audio discs using the latest formats. HD and Full HD video (720p and 1080p) are now fully supported for Blu-ray discs, and all the encoding is handled by Ashampoo Burning Studio 10. All the authoring tools have been overhauled and the video encoding quality is even better than before. You now use the same new integrated editor for building DVD and Blu-ray video disks with menus. The program also starts more quickly and is generally snappier to use.\n\nIn addition to this there is a new Autoplay Editor module with which you can build auto-starting data discs with attractive interactive menus ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ for example for collections of programs. And there is now also a new Audio Player with which you can play audio files and audio CDs without leaving the program.\n\n\nMore infos at\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www2.ashampoo.com/webcache/html/1/product_2_2610___EUR.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www2.ashampoo.com/webcache/html/1/product_2_2610___EUR.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nThe Portable SFX EXE file is built up using WinRAR. You can use it to extract the files and check them one by one if you want to be sure of what is running on your machine.\n\n\nThis has also been built on an XP x86 machine, I don't know if this program can run on a x64 or Vista/W7 machine. It's up to you to check it if you are using them.\n\n\n\nSUGGESTIONS ON USING P2P DOWNLOADS\n==================================\n\n1) It's always better to run all downloaded programs using Sandboxie or a similar virtual machine until you are sure they are clean.\n\n\n2) When in doubt, scan them with an Internet Scan service as the ones provided by Jotti and VirusTotal\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://virusscan.jotti.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://virusscan.jotti.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis will ***NOT*** give you any warranty that a file passing their analysis is clean, nor that if they see them as a troian it's so or not just another false positive, but helps you to decide and at least ask for help or infos.\n\n\n3) Remember, trust nobody, and when in doubt, go to point 1) \n\n\n4) If you find any upload containing trojans or whatsoever malicious or unclean, instead of start cursing in the comments of the upload, take the time to go to the Suprbay Forum at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nand report links and comments there, and someone will take care of all the nasties.\n\n\nThat's the only way to keep TPB and its uploads fresh and clean.\n\n\nThat's for what is regarding security. If after testing it you like it and it's useful for you, show your support buying it!\n\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f0e72c4b1cca2a8614a7e58cbcc0dc020a550d3","amp;dn":"Ashampoo+Burning+Studio+10+v10.0.1+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f0e72c4b1cca2a8614a7e58cbcc0dc020a550d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,14,114,196,177,204,162,168,97,74,126,88,203,204,13,192,32,165,80,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
