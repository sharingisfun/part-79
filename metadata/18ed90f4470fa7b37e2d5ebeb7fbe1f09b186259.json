The story is unlike any previous Tintin books, before or since: there are only a small number of characters and no enemies, villains, spies or gangsters. This adventure revolves around a rescue mission of Tintin's Chinese friend Chang Chong-Chen.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2a/Tintin_Cover_-_Tintin_in_Tibet.JPG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2a/Tintin_Cover_-_Tintin_in_Tibet.JPG&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nenjoi,\n\nsani\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18ed90f4470fa7b37e2d5ebeb7fbe1f09b186259","amp;dn":"The+Adventures+of+Tintin+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+Tintin+in+Tibet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18ed90f4470fa7b37e2d5ebeb7fbe1f09b186259","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,237,144,244,71,15,167,179,126,45,94,190,183,251,225,240,155,24,98,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
