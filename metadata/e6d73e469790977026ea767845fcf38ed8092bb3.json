IF I HAVE IT I WILL ADD IT TO MY LIST!!!\n\nPlot+++++++++\nMore than 10 years after 'Terminator 2', John Connor now exists only as a drifter - living 'off the grid', so no more Terminators from the future can hunt him down. Unfortunately, SkyNet does send another one back - and this one is called the T-X, even more powerful &amp; advanced than the dreaded T-1000. However, another CSM-101 Terminator is also sent back to protect John against the T-X. Now, Skynet is patiently assuming control of civilian computer systems, under the guise of a computer virus. John has also met his future wife, Kate Brewster, whose father - a U.S. Air Force General - is in charge of the military computer systems &amp; is leery of up linking SkyNet. However, when the SkyNet virus infects the U.S military computers &amp; leaves the country open to attack, the machines begin their horrific takeover. Soon a nuclear war will result - and the war against the machines will begin. Can the outdated CSM-101 Terminator eliminate the highly advanced T-X - or will a darker future await man following the nuclear attack?\n\nMain Movie+++++++++++\n+Format-NTSC (USA/R1)\n+Video-Untouched DVD9\n+Audio-English, French\n+Subs-English, Spanish, French\n\nMenu+++++++\n+Yes\n              \nExtras/Special Features+++++++\n+Yes\n\nRemoved+++++++\n+Nothing\n\nPlease Seed!!
