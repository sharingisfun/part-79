It's a gimmicky excuse for a collection, but it works, not only because the songs and performances are good, but because the tracks all have a similar spirit. Among the highlights are tracks by Memphis Minnie, Mississippi Sheiks, Robert Hicks, the Memphis Jug Band, Amos Easton, Lucille Bogan, Peetie Wheatstraw and Joshua White. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide \n\n\nTracks\nTrack Title Composers Performers Time \nYou Drink Too Much State Street Swingers State Street Swingers (3:13) \nCherry Wine Woman  Charley Jordan (2:50) \nDrunken Barrel House Blues Kansas Joe McCoy Memphis Minnie (2:49) \nBootlegger's Blues Mississippi Sheiks Mississippi Sheiks (3:31) \nMe and My Whiskey  Robert Hicks (3:06) \nBug Juice Blues  Kid Prince Moore (2:38) \nRock and Rye  Charlie Spand (2:36) \nRukus Juice and Chittlin'  Memphis Jug Band (2:50) \nBad Whiskey Blues  Merline Johnson (2:34) \nI Keep on Drinkin (To Drive My Blues Away), Pt.
