However a few minutes later he calls back but Lovato ignores the phone and heads to the stage where she performs. Her boyfriend is shown visiting the concert, and after Lovato is finished the performance she heads back to her dressing room, where he meets her with a rose, thus beginning their relationship again, staying true to the theme of the song.\n\nOn July 3, 2009, the song debuted at number fifty-one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and number eighty-six on the Canadian Hot 100, eventually peaking at number sixty-one.
