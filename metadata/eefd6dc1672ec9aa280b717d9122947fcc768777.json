It features the heavy percussion and wind solos of Crystal Chronicles, but retains the strings backing the orchestrated Ring of Fates carried. Definitely enjoyable to those that found FFCC or FFCC:RoF's OSTs enjoyable.\n\n\n...Sorry. I don't believe I know which version it is. I'd guess Wii, but it's a tough call. Nonetheless, enjoy some more of this composer's work.\n\nIt must not be the wii version.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eefd6dc1672ec9aa280b717d9122947fcc768777","amp;dn":"Final+Fantasy+Crystal+Chronicles%3A+Echoes+of+Time+OST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eefd6dc1672ec9aa280b717d9122947fcc768777","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,253,109,193,103,46,201,170,40,11,113,125,145,34,148,127,204,118,135,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
