The music was composed by guitarist Rudolf Schenker and the lyrics by singer Klaus Meine.\n\nThe video featured model Joan Severance\n\nIn the United States the song peaked at #6 on the Mainstream Rock Chart and at #75 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nSavage Amusement is the tenth studio album by the German heavy metal band Scorpions, released in 1988. It peaked at #5 in the USA where it became platinum that June.\n\nThe album was the follow up to the successful Love at First Sting and had some musical differences when compared to its predecessor. The overall feel of the album shows that Scorpions wanted to experiment with some different genres, going to a more radio friendly style and incorporating more synthesized sounds. While there are still some straight hard rock songs, like &quot;Don't Stop At The Top&quot; and &quot;Media Overkill&quot;, there are also progressive rock songs such as &quot;Walking On The Edge&quot; and &quot;Passion Rules The Game&quot;.\n\nScorpions are a heavy metal/hard rock band from Hanover, Germany, probably best known for their 1980s rock anthem &quot;Rock You Like a Hurricane&quot; and their singles &quot;No One Like You&quot;, &quot;Send Me an Angel, &quot;Still Loving You&quot;, and &quot;Wind of Change&quot;. The band has sold over 75 million albums worldwide and were ranked #46 on VH1's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock program.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:393541b4b42b4898f84e421e1b4a2f34374a983f","amp;dn":"Scorpions+-+Rhythm+Of+Love","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"393541b4b42b4898f84e421e1b4a2f34374a983f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,53,65,180,180,43,72,152,248,78,66,30,27,74,47,52,55,74,152,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
