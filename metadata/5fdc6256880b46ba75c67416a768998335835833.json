In my opinion, at the finishing line there will be a pack of around fifty riders. But itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a rugged route on which all sorts of things could happen. In 1995, it was on a stage similar to this one that Miguel Indurain attacked on the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“bumpsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ of LiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ge-Bastogne-LiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ge and broke away with Johan Bruyneel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fdc6256880b46ba75c67416a768998335835833","amp;dn":"2010+Tour+De+France+%28in+HD%29+-+Stage+2+-+2010-07-05+%28Cycling%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fdc6256880b46ba75c67416a768998335835833","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,220,98,86,136,11,70,186,117,198,116,22,167,104,153,131,53,131,88,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
