The band rose to success in 1999 when the track &quot;Brackish&quot; from their debut album Spit became a hit single. The band also supported Slipknot during the early 2000s on Slipknot's UK tour, heightening the band's popularity.\n\nKittie was formed in 1996, when Mercedes Lander and Fallon Bowman met in an extracurricular gymnastics class. The lead singer and guitarist, Morgan Lander, is the sister of drummer and band co-founder Mercedes. Their original bassist was Tanya Candler, who eventually left the band in the winter of 1999 to finish high school. Talena Atfield was selected as the new bassist.\n\nIn 2001, Fallon Bowman left Kittie without citing her reasons and eventually started a new project called Amphibious Assault. Fallon's position as guitarist was later filled by Jeff Phillips who worked as Kittie's guitar technician. He now plays guitar for Thine Eyes Bleed.\n\nIn 2002, Talena Atfield left and was replaced on bass guitar by Jennifer Arroyo. In 2004, the group added a fourth member, the second guitarist Lisa Marx, and Jeff Phillips went to work full-time on his side project, Thine Eyes Bleed.\n\nIn 2004, Kittie released the album Until the End.\n\nOn 26 June, 2009, Kittie announced that they had signed to the E1 Music label. A new album, entitled In the Black, was released on 15 September 2009. Videos were shot for two singles, &quot;Cut Throat&quot; and &quot;Sorrow I Know&quot;. &quot;Cut Throat&quot; premiered on MTV 2's Headbangers ball on 5 September 2009 and on Canadian show Much Loud on 20 September 2009.\n\nOn 16 September 2009, an announcement was made that Massacre Records would distribute &quot;In the Black&quot; in Europe and that it would be made available there on 23 October 2009.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1ff26ae064cbc057b47f43ca20d034f1d0f21b2","amp;dn":"Kittie+-+Cut+Throat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1ff26ae064cbc057b47f43ca20d034f1d0f21b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,255,38,174,6,76,188,5,123,71,244,60,162,13,3,79,29,15,33,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
