Geils Band. The album embodies musical and production sophistication not found in previous albums by the band.\n\nWhat makes the album outstanding is that despite the new-found polish the band acquired with this record the grit, rhythm, pathos and plain old fun which is a trademark of &quot;the bad boys from Boston&quot; still is everpresent.\n\nThe song &quot;One Last Kiss&quot; received great radio play at the time it was released and is an upbeat blue-inspired rocker of love lost.\n\n&quot;Sanctuary&quot;, the title track features Peter Wolf's vocal at their most expressive and some wicked harp by Magic Dick.\n\nThe song &quot;Teresa&quot; is simply one of the best pop songs I've heard by any band. Again Wolf's vocals are at their most expressive; they are plaintive and heart rending, matching Seth Justman's piano.\n\n&quot;Wildman&quot; and &quot;Jus' Can't Stop Me&quot; are great party rave-ups,\n\nAll songs written by Seth Justman and Peter Wolf\n\n1. &quot;I Could Hurt You&quot; 3:53\n2. &quot;One Last Kiss&quot; 4:19\n3. &quot;Take It Back&quot; 3:18\n4. &quot;Sanctuary&quot; 3:50\n5. &quot;Teresa&quot; 3:46\n6. &quot;Wild Man&quot; 5:22\n7. &quot;I Can't Believe You&quot; 4:11\n8. &quot;I Don't Hang Around Much Anymore&quot; 4:37\n9. &quot;Jus' Can't Stop Me&quot; 3:36","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1cd34cb251dc737346ce2cf2cbb685242add7a1","amp;dn":"The+J.+Geils+Band+-+Sanctuary+CDRip+%5BCov%2BCD%5D%5BBubanee%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1cd34cb251dc737346ce2cf2cbb685242add7a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,205,52,203,37,29,199,55,52,108,226,207,44,187,104,82,66,173,215,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
