He was signed to a joint venture between Scooter Braun's Schoolboy Music and Steve RifkindÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s SRC Records. His first professional release was on June 13, 2008 when the DJ Drama and Don Cannon-helmed The GreenHouse Effect Mixtape was released for free via RothÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s website Thedailykush.com. Roth was featured on the cover of XXL magazineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s annual Top 10 Freshmen: Hip-HopÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Class ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢09 issue. Roth's debut album, Asleep in the Bread Aisle, was released April 20, 2009.\n\nSometime in mid 2008, Roth announced he would be making a full studio album and it would be released sometime in early 2009. He started recording in late 2008, and continued into 2009. The first single released was titled, &quot;I Love College&quot;, which received many hits across North America. His second single was titled, &quot;Lark on my Go-Kart&quot;. After the 2 singles were released, Roth's studio album, Asleep in the Bread Aisle, was released on April 20, 2009.\n\nThe album contains a song titled, &quot;As I Em&quot;, which was made to confront the problem between him and fellow rapper, Eminem. It was not a diss, but it was to tell people to stop asking why he has a similar voice inflection to Eminem. Eminem later heard this song, and co-signed Asher Roth.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2243abac3882f652cb30232b7091d7a236b2d26a","amp;dn":"Asher+Roth+feat.+Keri+Hilson+-+She+Don%5C%27t+Wanna+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2243abac3882f652cb30232b7091d7a236b2d26a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,67,171,172,56,130,246,82,203,48,35,43,112,145,215,162,54,178,210,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
