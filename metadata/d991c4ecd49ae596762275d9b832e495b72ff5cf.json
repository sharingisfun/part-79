Warren\n\nInvestigative mythologist and author William Henry talked about the significance of the art and symbols in the U.S. Capitol. The Capitol was thought of as a recreation of Solomon's Temple by its builders, Freemasons, who conceived of the building as a &quot;beehive&quot; buzzing with energy, he said. Higher wisdom flows through the Capitol's spiritual imagery, particularly in the painting, The Apotheosis of Washington (see images below), which is featured in the dome of the Rotunda, he shared, adding that the dome of the Capitol is a mirror image of the one in the Vatican. The painting depicts the first President as a deified being along with five pagan gods who are symbols for alchemy.\n\nHe noted that a scene in Dan Brown's new bestseller, The Lost Symbol, features a character staring up into the Capitol dome and seeing the painting transform into a gateway. This imagery shares similarities to Henry's work into stargates or portals, which he believes humans can ascend to higher consciousness. The bell-shaped Capitol Dome could be thought of as a kind of stupa that creates a vortex or field of energy, he continued.\n\nInterestingly, Henry detailed that the Capitol contains a &quot;crypt&quot;, one story beneath the Rotunda. It has 40 columns and was modeled after the ancient Temple of Poseidon-- this was a way for the United States to pay homage to Atlantis, he commented.\n\n\nFive Scariest Cryptids\n\nAppearing in the last hour, paranormal investigator Joshua P. Warren counted down his 'Top 5 Scariest Cryptids,' beings that reportedly infiltrate our world, and defy notions of what is possible. These five can be considered &quot;phantimals,&quot; creatures that can suddenly appear and disappear, yet seem quite physical:\n\n5) Devil Dragons-- seen in South Carolina, these huge pterodactyl-like creatures have piercing eyes and flapping wings.\n\n4) Batsquatch-- with glowing yellow eyes, this flying creature reportedly caused a truck's engine to shut off near Mount Rainier.\n\n3) Wendigo-- according to Native American lore, this hairy shape-shifting giant was once a human, but after performing acts of cannibalism, it turned into a shaggy monster.\n\n2) Hellhounds-- Dating back hundreds of years, reports detail hulking Rottweiler-like dogs that suddenly appear and tear people to shreds.\n\n1) Popobawa-- A 7 ft. tall black-winged demonic entity that is said to brutally molest men in Zanzibar.\n\nWarren's associate, Micah Hanks, of The Gralien Report, has also composed a list of horrific cyptids.\n\nWebsite(s):\nwilliamhenry.net\njoshuapwarren.com\n\nVideo(s):\nMorph: The Secret of Light Body Activation\nThe American Rite\n\nBook(s):\nFreedomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Gate: The Lost Symbols in the U.S. Capitol\nThe Secret Wisdom of Kukulkan\nHow to Hunt Ghosts\n\n\n\nbrought to you by:\n                                                \n .d8888b.                                                      888    \nd88P  Y88b                                                     888    \n888    888                                                     888    \n888    888 888  888  .d88b.  888d888 .d8888b  8888b.  .d8888b  888888 \n888    888 888  888 d8P  Y8b 888P&quot;  d88P&quot;        &quot;88b 88K      888    \n888    888 Y88  88P 88888888 888    888      .d888888 &quot;Y8888b. 888    \nY88b  d88P  Y8bd8P  Y8b.     888    Y88b.    888  888      X88 Y88b.  \n &quot;Y8888P&quot;    Y88P    &quot;Y8888  888     &quot;Y8888P &quot;Y888888  88888P'  &quot;Y888 \n\nTorrents: http://thepiratebay.se/user/0vercast/\nRSS: http://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/2eb7e342dacfa8938e79732ad03e1224","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d991c4ecd49ae596762275d9b832e495b72ff5cf","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+AM+-+Sep+22+2009+-+Lost+Symbols+of+US+Capitol","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d991c4ecd49ae596762275d9b832e495b72ff5cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,145,196,236,212,154,229,150,118,34,117,217,184,50,228,149,183,47,245,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
