ARTERY\nFrench metal band created in April 2005.\nLine up : THIERRY (guitar), FRED (guitar), SIMON (drums, since May 2008) , and MANU (bass and voice).\n\nInfluenced by traditional heavy metal and thrash metal bands, with a little bit of death metal influences too.\n\nWith hammers instead of picks, ARTERY keeps the die-hard metal flame up. With its heavy and powerful riffs, its tenacious melodies, ARTERY is a real indestructible and infernal engine, generated by four arteries who can only make the heads shaking.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bae63bfec9ac94f26d4b0bc4f6118dcff5ac8f3d","amp;dn":"ARTERY+-+Avoid+the+unknown+2009+-+thrash+metal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bae63bfec9ac94f26d4b0bc4f6118dcff5ac8f3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,230,59,254,201,172,148,242,109,75,11,196,246,17,141,207,245,172,143,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
