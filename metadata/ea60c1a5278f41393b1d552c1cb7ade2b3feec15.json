Additionally, Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂµTorrent supports the Protocol Encryption joint specification (compatible with Azureus 2.4.0.0 and above, BitComet 0.63 and above) and peer exchange.\n\n\nResource-Friendly\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚ÂµTorrent was written with efficiency in mind.\nUnlike many torrent clients, it does not hog valuable system resources - typically using less than 6MB of memory, allowing you to use the computer as if it weren't there at all. Additionally, the program itself is contained within a single executable less than 220 KB in size.\n\n\nSkinnable and Localized\n\nVarious icon, toolbar graphic and status icon replacements are available, and creating your own is very simple. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂµTorrent also has support for localization, and with a language file present, will automatically switch to your system language. If your language isn't available, you can easily add your own, or edit other existing translations to improve them!\n\n\nActively Developed and Improved\n\nThe development team puts in a lot of time working on features and making things more user-friendly. Releases only come out when they're ready, with no schedule pressures, so the few bugs that appear are quickly addressed and fixed.\n\n\nChangelog:\n\nHere's a new release for the 1.8.x line with some additional bugfixes. The 1.8 line is stable, so only fixes and minor tweaks will be added from here on out. All new features will go into 2.0.\n\n\n\n2009-09-25: Version 1.8.4 (build 16667)\n\nChange: Balance CDNs to download updates\n\n\nFix: Fixes bug where magnet links wouldn't work if PEX was disabled\n\nFix: Potential crash in network code\n\nFix: More crashes when using magnet links\n\n\n\n2009-09-10: Version 1.8.4 (build 16442)\n\nFix: Potential crashes with magnet links\n\n\n\n2009-09-04: Version 1.8.4 (build 16381)\n\nChange: Disable Ask for unsupported 64-bit Windows\n\n\nFix: Buffer overrun vulnerability\n\n\nChange: Conservative network locking in installer\n\n\n\n2009-08-28: Version 1.8.4 (build 16301)\n\nFix: Installer crash after download\n\nFix: Crash when peers disconnect from a magnet-link torrent right as we received the metadata\n\n\n\n2009-08-27: Version 1.8.4 (build 16286)\n\nFix: Fixed negative allocation in RequestChunks() for web seeds\n\nFix: Fix startup race condition between network and disk I/O thread\n\nFix: Installer with UAC\n\nFix: Crashes when removing labels\n\nFix: Selection of labels over 256 characters in length\n\n\n\n2009-08-12: Version 1.8.4 (build 16150)\n\nFeature: Enabled magnet bundles.\n\n\nChange: Run the 64 bit version of explorer when running as a 32 bit app in a 64 bit windows os.\n\nChange: Disable toolbar offers for Wine installs\n\nChange: Uninstaller is added to all user profiles\n\n\nFix: Crash when assigning new label to torrents from RSS\n\n\nChange: Incomplete downloads sort after completed downloads if sorting by &quot;Completed On&quot;\n\nFix: Maintain category list selection on update for some edge cases\n\n\nChange: If selected, install start menu and desktop shortcuts to all users instead of only current user\n\n\nFix: Buffer overrun vulnerability in create torrent dialog\n\nFix: Check at startup for incompatible versions of NVIDIA nForce firewall\n\n\n\n2009-07-30: Version 1.8.3 (build 16010)\n\nChange: Toolbar installer version\n\n\nFix: Buffer overrun vulnerability in create torrent dialog\n\n\n\n2009-07-07: Version 1.8.3 (build 15772)\n\nChange: Detect nvlsp too (previously it only detected nvappfilter).
