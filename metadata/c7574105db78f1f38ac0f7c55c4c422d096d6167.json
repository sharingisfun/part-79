We truly enjoy seeing other   \n        garbage scene groups especially in this section call out other      \n        xvid groups they believe they are better than, even tho that\n        same exact group was caught in the past with proof that they had\n        been stealing from p2p as well.\n\n        We're Back!!! Ok this is out first trial cam we figured we'd put it\n\tout there because its better than the overcropped cam already out.\n\tQuality would be flawless if it wasnt for that massive flicker,\n\twhich cant be fixed through hardware, any suggestions short of a\n        new cam. Any ways the kings of the homemades have returned, this \n\twould be above our orc standards but the flicker degrades the video\n\ta little bit... time will fix that tho. And as always kids remember\n\tif you don't like any of our releases you can suck the ORC FAT ONE!\n\n       &lt;MrPricklePants&gt;\n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n                                                                             \n  \n \n     \n        \n                                                        \n                                                 \n          ORC Wonders...\n        \n\n         ...Where did all the COMPETITION go?\n          \n           \n\n            ORC requires a few select people to fill some positions\n           \n\n           \u0007 You Work At a theater (and are perferably a manager)\n\n           \u0007 You can get RETAIL DVD's before release date\n\n           \u0007 Get any sort of direct audio in ANY LANGUAGE for current-running films\n\n           \u0007 You have access to DVD RETAIL/DVDSCR/TC/SCR/CAM (Yes!
