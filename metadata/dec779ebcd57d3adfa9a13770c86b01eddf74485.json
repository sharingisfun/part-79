Talented but abrasive, Clough alienates some of those around him, including his rival, Don Revie. When Clough has the chance to coach Leeds, RevieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s former team, he takes on the role of the manager of the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s best soccer team. Also starring Timothy Spall, Jim Broadbent, and Colm Meaney, this film marks the fourth time screenwriter Peter Morgan has crafted a character for Sheen.\n\nThis has 2 flaws : a timer and a property message. Everything else is ok.\n\n*******************************\nMovieFOX\nJoin us at http://moviefox.org\n*******************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dec779ebcd57d3adfa9a13770c86b01eddf74485","amp;dn":"The.Damned.united.2009.DVDSc.XviD-Wobferry.avi%5Bmoviefox.org%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dec779ebcd57d3adfa9a13770c86b01eddf74485","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,199,121,235,205,87,211,173,250,154,19,119,12,134,176,30,221,247,68,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
