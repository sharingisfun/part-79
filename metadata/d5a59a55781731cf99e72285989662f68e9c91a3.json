Pretty interesting when you hear how Amy Fisher tried to sell her candy to distract Mary from the gunman on the side of her house.  Blowjobs and money to kill someone?  I'd take the blow job and then call the cops on her haha.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5a59a55781731cf99e72285989662f68e9c91a3","amp;dn":"Howard+TV+-+Mary+Jo+Buttafuoco+07-28-09%28wush%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5a59a55781731cf99e72285989662f68e9c91a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,165,154,85,120,23,49,207,153,231,34,133,152,150,98,246,142,156,145,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
