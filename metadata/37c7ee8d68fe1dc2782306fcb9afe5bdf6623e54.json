But, when we call   |\n|  her a singer/songwriter she tends to lean towards a Bjork and Tori Amos   |\n|  sound over your conventional singers out there. When the record first     |\n|  strikes up and that quite and minimalistic beat kicks in you know that    |\n|  &quot;Lobotomy Sessions&quot; is going to be a special record.                      |\n|                                                                            |\n|  The record gives us a lot of different styles and looks. Starting with a  |\n|  track like &quot;Martian Rendezvous&quot; which is very &quot;Bjorkian&quot; in style and     |\n|  substance. The track is built around a lot of odd noises and the          |\n|  occasional string pops in and out of the track. &quot;Casket Salesman&quot; has     |\n|  the structure and the hook that could make it a solid pop song but the    |\n|  music sounds like a mix of Massive Attack meets the Adams Family theme    |\n|  song. But, the results are really cool as the finger snapping and the     |\n|  old rickety noises give it that full effect. &quot;Circus Cosmos&quot; gives out    |\n|  that bedroom recording styles with a sweet track that has a great         |\n|  overall lo-fi sound.                                                      |\n|                                                                            |\n|  Alu's second album is a stunning record that drives you from start to     |\n|  finish. The record is a perfect late night record as it gives plenty of   |\n|  a dark shaded tracks for you to hide underneath and get thrown into a     |\n|  sweet slumber. &quot;Lobotomy Sessions&quot; is a dark and mysterious track that    |\n|  will up Alu's stature. She has a great voice for the downtempo chilled    |\n|  out style of pop. I would love to hear her on the next Massive Attack     |\n|  record as well. -by John Siwicki                                          |\n|                                                                            |\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37c7ee8d68fe1dc2782306fcb9afe5bdf6623e54","amp;dn":"Alu+-+Lobotomy+Sessions+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37c7ee8d68fe1dc2782306fcb9afe5bdf6623e54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,199,238,141,104,254,29,194,120,35,6,252,185,175,229,189,246,98,62,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
