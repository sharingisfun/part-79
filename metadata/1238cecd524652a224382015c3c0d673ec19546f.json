During the show, Ayaan Hirsi Ali tells a story where a heckler demanded who gave her the right to criticize Islam. A counter-heckler shouted back: &quot;The First Amendment!&quot;\nGene writes:\n\nTechnically, the counter-heckler was not quite correct. The First [Amendment] does not give us rights, it protects rights that were, according to the preamble, endowed to us by our Creator.\n\nSome viewers still don't believe the First Amendment gives us the right to offend. Abdul Rehman wrote:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Free speechÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is everybodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s right and should be practiced. There is however a fine line between ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“free speechÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“offending speechÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. A fine line which the majority of Americans respect but IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m afraid you are defending the minority view here.\n\nDerogatory actions and remarks are NOT protected as freedom of speech!\n\nHelen wrote:\n\nI am so impressed with Ayaan Hirsi Ali! What an incredibly brave woman! More people should honor the First Amendment in the ways that she does. Why is this subject avoided by the press? Precisely because of what she said ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ they are all afraid.\n\nMyles wrote:\n\nWhile I rarely agree with JohnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more libertarian (and contrarian) views, I agree 100% with him on this.\n\nSomething has to be done to stem this descent.\n\nPlease donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t blame the President, this era (error) of political correctness has been growing for over 40 years\n\nNo Social Justice wrote:\n\nI miss John Stossel. I really wish I got Fox Business where I live ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ or could find his shows online. Maybe one day. /Sigh.\n\nCall your cable or satellite provider and demand it! (Or better yet, switch to a satellite provider who does carry Fox Business.) You can watch all my shows on Hulu. The First Amendment show will be up in about two weeks.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1238cecd524652a224382015c3c0d673ec19546f","amp;dn":"20100520-Stossel-%5BFree+Speech%5D.Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1238cecd524652a224382015c3c0d673ec19546f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,56,206,205,82,70,82,162,36,56,32,21,195,192,214,115,236,25,84,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
