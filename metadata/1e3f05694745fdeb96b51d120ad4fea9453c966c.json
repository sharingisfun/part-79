I couldn't find this ANYWHERE on the net for non-purchase, so I figured I'd share this with anyone else who wants it after i bought it.  Its in native m4a format, it shouldn't have any file protection.  If this is an issue, and you want me to convert to MP3, point me to a good m4a to mp3 tool and I'll be happy to do it.\n\nP.S.  Please seed, I will seed as much as i can, but it can't leave it up 24/7. Also, first upload, hope you all enjoy!\n\n-TÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â½r\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e3f05694745fdeb96b51d120ad4fea9453c966c","amp;dn":"BASS+UP%21+-+Hold+me+Back","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e3f05694745fdeb96b51d120ad4fea9453c966c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,63,5,105,71,69,253,235,150,181,29,18,10,212,254,169,69,60,150,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
