(i know, this sounds like henry louis gates going through the drive through at the cambridge police department IN HIS FUCKING HOUSE!!)   uhh, we had a noise complaint from these premises...  all proper and shit.   i was like, oh, sorry about that, i'm just recording some music and using some of jim morrison's poetry overdubs.   the cop said, &quot;really!?   i used to be a huge doors fan&quot;.   to my amazement, the fucking cop stood in my window and listened to the whole god damn track as i'm freakin' out about the intense aroma of pot still smoldering thoroughout the room.   he then said, well, that sounds really good, just turn it down a couple notches, and walked to his car and drove away.   still sitting in my desk chair, i swivel around and look at my pot pipe sitting on an end table with a magazine mostly covering it thinking, holy fucking crap...   not only did i NOT get busted, but i totally entertained the damn cops with my music.   fuck you whoever called in the complaint!!!\n\nis that funny shit or what??\n\nhaha!\n\nenjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52ff1b8b97882fc669e007a174862a8615f40904","amp;dn":"bill_dahlberg+-+parisian+dream+-+with+jim+morrison","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52ff1b8b97882fc669e007a174862a8615f40904","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,255,27,139,151,136,47,198,105,224,7,161,116,134,42,134,21,244,9,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
