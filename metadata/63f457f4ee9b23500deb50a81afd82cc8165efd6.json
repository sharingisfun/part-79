Building from a topic that feels especially relevant in the current economic climate, Overheard opens as a case of financial crime that escalates uncontrollably into violence and devastation. Three of Hong Kong's most popular leading men - Lau Ching Wan (Written), Louis Koo (Connected), and Daniel Wu (Shinjuku Incident) - play morally conflicted cops in this tense, unpredictable crime thriller. Co-produced by Derek Yee, Overheard also gets the top-notch supporting cast of Alex Fong Chung Sun (If You Are The One), Zhang Jingchu (Beast Stalker), Waise Lee (A Better Tomorrow), Lam Ka Wah (Look for a Star), pop idol William Chan in his film debut, and Michael Wong in an over-the-top scene-stealing turn as the nefarious businessman.\n\nCops Johnny (Lau Ching Wan), Gene (Louis Koo), and Max (Daniel Wu) are part of a special task force investigating a business firm that engages in financial crimes. While monitoring slimy executive Low (Waise Lee), Gene overhears an illegal stock tip. Street-smart Gene is married with kids, one of whom is battling cancer, and he himself has just been diagnosed with a terminal illness; he desperately wants to leave money behind for his family. Clean-cut Max is soon marrying into an overbearing rich family, and wants to prove himself financially. The two decide to make a gamble, and throw their life savings into the stock. Johnny who's harboring some secrets of his own - he's seeing the estranged wife (Zhang Jingchu) of his superior (Alex Fong) - covers for them. For these three cops who have always played it straight, all it takes is one wrong step to send them into a vicious crime spiral of no return.\n\nAudio : Cantonese, Mandarin - Dolby Digital 5.1 - 448 Kbps\n\nSubs (removable): English, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese\n\nRuntime: 100 min\nBit rate : 5 009 Kbps\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\nNTSC\n16:9\ncustom added sub and menu","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63f457f4ee9b23500deb50a81afd82cc8165efd6","amp;dn":"Overheard+2009+BluRayRip+DVDR-sailo1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63f457f4ee9b23500deb50a81afd82cc8165efd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,244,87,244,238,155,35,80,13,235,80,168,26,253,130,204,129,101,239,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
