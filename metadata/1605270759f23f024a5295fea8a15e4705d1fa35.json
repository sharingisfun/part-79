When Arne Heesch started to shout he must have seen red ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ these moments of flaming anger had a very cathartic quality. Hard to say if it worked for him, but it sure enough presented a reverse - primal scream therapy for the listener. And then ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ boom ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a fight among the band members, who by the way were two brothers and a cousin and that was it. The end.\n\nNow, after about six years of total silence between the brothers thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s this EP with the long, foreboding shadows of an old tree on its cover in the mailÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ It may sound pathetic, but simply looking at the cover can cause a certain stimulation in those, who knew Ulme from back in the day ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ euphoria and also a good amount of anxiety: What will the reformed brothers plus new bassist give us? Do we still need it? Will it be the same as it used to be? If not, will we like the difference? Well long story cut short: They havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t changed much; the four songs sound like the logical consequences of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGreen growing soulÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ A little easier to access, thanks to the powerful yet transparent production of Guido Lucas and thanks to clearer structures and melody. A glimpse of optimism unheard of so far in UlmeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s universe in the opener ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe glowingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ adds up to a song, that almost spans all of the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music: The intensity, the epic flowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUngrounded beautiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ takes us back home to the dark groove andÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ here come the goose pimplesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ here comes that howl.
