He insists he's innocent and only his brother Michael Scofield believes him. As an engineer who helped design the prison where Lincoln is being held, Michael takes drastic measures to help his brother. He gets himself arrested and sent to the same prison so that with his knowledge of the building the two of them can escape together. However, while inside, Michael discovers a massive conspiracy that is determined to see Lincoln's sentence carried out. Breaking out will be more difficult than he thought, but he's still going to try.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac2c7695de6f2b54a8074230d0db934c19f6e45e","amp;dn":"Prison.Break.Season1.Nordic.Pal.DVDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac2c7695de6f2b54a8074230d0db934c19f6e45e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,44,118,149,222,111,43,84,168,7,66,48,208,219,147,76,25,246,228,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
