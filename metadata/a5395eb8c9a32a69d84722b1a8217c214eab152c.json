In this episode, Bert Monroy focuses on recreating a single piece from Iron Man's arm.\n\n*** To create this piece of armor from scratch, create paths that outline the object.\n\nIn a new layer named Plate, fill the path with a gold color. Select the two paths that represent the indented area and fill with the gold color in a new layer named Indention. Use the Indention layer as a mask for the armor's base plate.\n\nUse Bevel and Emboss to create some depth to the indentions. Apply a blur to add smoothing. Add more Bevel and Embossing to the Plate layer.\n\nWith the burn tool, use a large, soft brush to add additional dimension to the Plate layer. This adds to the metallic affect. Use the dodge tool to add highlighted &quot;hot spots&quot; - this will be the glare of the metal.\n\n*** Create and Add Texture\n\nIn a new layer named Texture, we will create the metallic texture. Fill the canvas with 50% grey and add some noise and motion blur at 90 degrees. Tighten the levels to add more definition to the vertical lines. The ocean ripple filter adds more to the metal appearance. With the texture created, you can then change the layer style to Overlay, which will apply the texture to the golden plate. Clip this layer to the Plate layer to keep the texture within the armor's boundaries.\n\nWarp the texture layer (Transform &gt; warp) to match the corners of the texture to the shape of the armor. Pull in anchored points to create a matching curvature.\n\nIn the indented areas of the armor, create a new layer and apply a soft, smaller white brush in the area where there's a glare. Distort the texture area only inside the Indention area. You can add detail by using another warp to only the indention area.\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nAll episodes can be streamed at Revision3 (duh!) but they can also be downloaded directly from the Revision3 site (they redirect to fast bitgravity servers) at various resolutions and video formats.
