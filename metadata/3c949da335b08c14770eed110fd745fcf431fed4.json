Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) and 400 young fathers, husbands, brothers, and sons, all troopers from an elite American combat division, were surrounded by 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers. The ensuing battle was one of the most savage in U.S. history. We Were Soldiers Once...And Young is a tribute to the nobility of those men under fire, their common acts of uncommon valor, and their loyalty to and love for one another.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c949da335b08c14770eed110fd745fcf431fed4","amp;dn":"We+Were+Soldiers+%282002%29+PAL+DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c949da335b08c14770eed110fd745fcf431fed4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,148,157,163,53,176,140,20,119,14,237,17,15,215,69,252,244,49,254,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
