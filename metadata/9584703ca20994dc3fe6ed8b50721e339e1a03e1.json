Please give back as much as you take.\n\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½11 April 2008\nZach Williams tells Kate to write to the Rhode Island Bar, Massachusetts Bar, Conneticut and New York Bars telling them that Liz Canterbury is under indictment. He then offers Ethan Foster immunity if he supports his case to find Liz guilty of jury tampering as Liz's team check into old cases ran out of Zach's office including that of Danny Santos. Liz resigns herself to the fact that she is about to face a prison sentence and puts her home on the market, tells her father and tells the staff to get new jobs but her indignant colleagues assemble a strong case to prove that Williams is on a witch hunt and go as far as to piecing together documents Williams shred. Eventually Zach and Liz strike a deal to release Santos and Russell will take the blame as he worked in Zach's office at the time he was indicted. Liz makes a deal to make sure the Bar don't come after Russell by getting a newspaper article written about him.\n\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0956036/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9584703ca20994dc3fe6ed8b50721e339e1a03e1","amp;dn":"Canterburys+Law+S01E05+-+Trade-Off.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9584703ca20994dc3fe6ed8b50721e339e1a03e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,132,112,60,162,9,148,220,63,230,237,139,80,114,30,51,158,26,3,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
