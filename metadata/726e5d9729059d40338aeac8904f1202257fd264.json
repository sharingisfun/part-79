The idea was to get remove the need of base.lzm file for linux-live scripts. I have done just that. I added linuxrc and liblinuxlive scripts into initramfs then copy everything thing into /new_root folder mounted as tmpfs. I made sure the linuxrc is /sbin/init in the /new_root folder also. I move the mounted /proc, /sys, and /dev at the end of /sbin/init also.\n* Everything should work as i did in the last archiso-live. I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have same menu like i had in the older releases right now. So this is a english only release at the moment.\n* Boot option keyb is now keymap. lang is now locale. (locale will take the full name that /etc/rc.conf takes. ex. locale=en_US.UTF-8)\n* Also Xorg 1.8 is so good i donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t need chakra-hardware-detection from what i can tell. If you have problems with this iso please report them in the comments. That goes for any problems.\nEverything is up2date as of 8:00PM EST on 20100626.\n\nmd5sum : f7fee16f37650c5984444624df9e3858  archiso-live-2010-06-26.iso\nPackage list : http://arch-live.isawsome.net/iso/archiso/20100626/packages.list\nPackage changes : http://arch-live.isawsome.net/iso/archiso/20100626/update\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:726e5d9729059d40338aeac8904f1202257fd264","amp;dn":"archiso-live-2010-06-26.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"726e5d9729059d40338aeac8904f1202257fd264","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,110,93,151,41,5,157,64,51,138,234,200,144,79,18,2,37,127,210,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
