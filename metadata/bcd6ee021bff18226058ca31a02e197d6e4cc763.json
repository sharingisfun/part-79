In the not too distant future, humans have successfully colonized the planet Mars. Here scientists were experimenting on naturally occurring substances and using the colonizing humans as guinea pigs. The experiment went horribly wrong. Now, a group of marines and a scientist named Samantha Grimm are going to find out what happened. They teleport to Mars via a system known as the &quot;Arch&quot;. What they find are gruesome monsters hell bent on death and destruction. Samantha's brother John is also one of the marines sent to Mars to help.\n\nDuration: 01:52:44\nVideo: Xvid 800x336 23.98fps 786Kbps\nAudio: Dolby AC3 48000Hz 6ch 448Kbps\n\ncredit -IZON- BIG BIG BIG TIME &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcd6ee021bff18226058ca31a02e197d6e4cc763","amp;dn":"Doom+DVDRip+XviD-IZON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcd6ee021bff18226058ca31a02e197d6e4cc763","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,214,238,2,27,255,24,34,96,88,202,49,160,46,25,125,110,76,199,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
