The city is in a chaos, with martial arts masters from royal guards to local bandits gathering in the city vying for the map of Taizu Emperor Treasure. Foreign warriors including Yehe Changgong and Ninja woman Mingyue Xin from Okinawa also joins the race. In search of the map, fighters stay in the town and disguise themselves as civilians. Yehe and Mingyue Xin pretend to be a couple and run an inn, while others open various businesses as a disguise. They suffer humiliation from young landlord Xu Sanguan for housing rent and debt. What's worse, Xu begins to pursue Mingyue Xin's adopted daughter Tang; while town chief Gu falls for the beautiful Ninja woman. As the fighters feel trapped in the mundane life of the small town, the map is found.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d747cd0d26f2b3b15888dbf68f12407b41f3ace9","amp;dn":"Tracing+Shadow+%C3%A8%C2%BF%C2%BD%C3%A5%C2%BD%C2%B1+%282009%29+DVDRip+XviD-sailo1+%5BKung+Fu%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d747cd0d26f2b3b15888dbf68f12407b41f3ace9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,71,205,13,38,242,179,177,88,136,219,246,143,18,64,123,65,243,172,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
