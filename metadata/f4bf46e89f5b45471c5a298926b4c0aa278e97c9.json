While many of their stories are heartwarming and play into our self-image of American compassion and generosity, the realities are much more complex. According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, adoptees have significantly more behavioral problems than non-adopted children. 'Adopted' reveals the grit rather than the glamor of trans-racial adoption. First-time director, Barb Lee, goes deep into the intimate lives of two well-meaning families and shows us the subtle challenges they face. One family is just beginning the process of adopting a baby from China and is filled with hope and possibility. The other family's adopted Korean daughter is now 32 years old. Prompted by her adoptive mother's terminal illness, she tries to create the bond they never had. The results are riveting, unpredictable and telling. While the two families are at opposite ends of the journey, their stories converge to show us that love alone isn't enough to make a family work.\n\nIMDb RATING: 8.7/10 (11 votes)\n\nDuration                         : 1h 19mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 216 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 19mn\nBit rate                         : 1 131 Kbps\nWidth                            : 560 pixels\nHeight                           : 304 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nResolution                       : 8 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.222\nStream size                      : 645 MiB (93%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 19mn\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 71.6 Kbps\nMinimum bit rate                 : 40.0 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 1 channel\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 40.9 MiB (6%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 24 ms (0.72 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 297 ms\nWriting library                  : LAME3.95\nEncoding settings                : -m m -V 5 -q 3 -lowpass 17 --vbr-old -b 40\n\ncredit SPRiNTER &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nBIG BIG BIG GREETZ &amp; THANKS:\nALL members &amp; STAFFS of PIRATEBAY, EXTRATORRENT, KINGDOM, DEMONOID, AHASHARE &amp; MOVIE-TORRENTZ :)\nKaOsUSC, Motley Crue, InFeCtiouS, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, UniversalAbsurdity, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld, wrath, oziman, rubak1, BigPerm1828, skynetcentral, IZON, bluepeas, extremezone &amp; many more :)\nALL the awesome people who are SHARING (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY, even the CRITICIZERS )\n***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4bf46e89f5b45471c5a298926b4c0aa278e97c9","amp;dn":"Adopted.2008.DVDRip.XViD-SPRiNTER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4bf46e89f5b45471c5a298926b4c0aa278e97c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,191,70,232,159,91,69,71,28,90,41,137,38,180,192,170,39,142,151,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
