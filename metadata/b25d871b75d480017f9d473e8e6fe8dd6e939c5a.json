These can be used in a wide range of applications, from how a characterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s eyes follow an object, to how a character might pick up a staff. While the latter is relatively straightforward to rig, what about situations when an object must pick up a character? This lecture gives an in-depth look at techniques that can be used to animate character/object interactions including situations when a character may jump from one moving object onto another.\n\n\nPoint Constraint\nOrient Constraint\nAim Constraint\n\t\n\nLocators\nConnection Editor\nScripts\n\n01: Introduction\n02: Basics\n03: Handoff\n04: Aim Constraint\n05: Character/Object\n06: Object/Character\n07: Credits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b25d871b75d480017f9d473e8e6fe8dd6e939c5a","amp;dn":"GNOMON+-+CONSTRAINTS+1+CHARACTER+OBJECT+INTERACTION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b25d871b75d480017f9d473e8e6fe8dd6e939c5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,93,135,27,117,212,128,1,127,157,71,62,142,111,232,221,110,147,156,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
