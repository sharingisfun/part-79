They want to fast-track their overprotected \nbrats into fully functioning, independent adults using real life challenges in just \nfour weeks.\n\nWith the prize of a round-the-world trip on offer, these eight 17- to 25-year-olds give up their home comforts for a house in south-east London where they must fend for themselves for the very first time - cooking, cleaning and, worst of all for \nthem, working. Each episode, the most useless kid is ejected by the people who made them what they are - their parents.\n\nLife alone gets off to a cold start when a lack of hot water sends the housemates into a spin, and they endure their first ever day of hard graft running a hotel in central London.\n\nAfter watching the first episode, let me know if you want to see more of these horrible people and I'll upload it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ed01ea5b366f8421bf76dbbcc462025b9f6e1f9","amp;dn":"Young%2C+Dumb+and+Living+off+Mum+S01E01.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ed01ea5b366f8421bf76dbbcc462025b9f6e1f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,208,30,165,179,102,248,66,27,247,109,187,204,70,32,37,185,246,225,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
