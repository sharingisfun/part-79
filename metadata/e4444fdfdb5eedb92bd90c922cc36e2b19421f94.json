They are knocked unconscious, and land in a snow-covered area. They venture out, and discover that they have become victims of time dilation and are in Earth's future. They theorize, from seeing mass numbers of time-worn graves and after having had their ship's instruments register residual radiation across the planet, that humanity has been largely destroyed by a devastating atomic war in 2188 and that they are at least 200 years after that (they later learn the year is actually 2508). One of the four astronauts, Henry Jaffe, is particularly grief-stricken as he realizes that his wife and children have long since died.\n\nAfter surviving attacks by giant, horrifying mutant spiders, they are attacked by one of two competing remnants of human society. There are surface dwellers who live in a primitive hunter-gatherer system, and who are one-eyed violent, savage mutations. They have been deformed by generations of exposure to residual radioactivity, and they cruelly dominate a segement of 'normal' (non-mutated) human tribesmen who dwell among them. The leader of the mutants is the vicious Naga. It is one of the one-eyed mutants that assaults the astronauts.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049964/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049964/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nMy upload page @ SB &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=33643&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=33643&lt;/a&gt;\t\n\nThis is a DVDRip of the Movie in .MKV format You will need VLC Player/Windows media player to view the movie.\n\nThanks go to tehParadox.\n\n\nScreen shots &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=33643&amp;pid=383004#pid383004&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=33643&amp;pid=383004#pid383004&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4444fdfdb5eedb92bd90c922cc36e2b19421f94","amp;dn":"World+Without+End+%281956%29+dvd.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4444fdfdb5eedb92bd90c922cc36e2b19421f94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,68,79,223,219,94,237,185,43,217,12,146,44,195,110,43,25,66,31,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
