However, when they released their fourth demo, Total Fucking Darkness, their genre became more akin to black metal. Their &quot;true&quot; black metal status however, has been in debate since near the time they became popular.[36] Dani, in a 1998 interview for BBC Radio 5 for example, said &quot;I use the term heavy metal, rather than black metal, because I think that's a bit of a fad now. Call it what you like: death metal, black metal, any kind of metal...&quot;,[37] while Gavin Baddeley's 2006 Terrorizer interview states that &quot;few folk, the band included, call Cradle black metal these days.\n\nThe band's style has been described as symphonic black metal,[39] gothic black metal,[40] and dark metal.[41] However, the band's evolving sound has allowed them to continue resisting definitive categorisation. They are audibly influenced by Iron Maiden, have collaborated on projects like Christian Death's Born Again Anti-Christian album (on the track &quot;Peek-A-Boo&quot;), and have even dabbled outside of metal music with dance remixes (&quot;Twisting Further Nails&quot;, &quot;Pervert's Church&quot; etc), although these have fallen by the wayside in recent years. In a 2006 interview with Terrorizer magazine, current guitarist Paul Allender said &quot;We were never a black metal band. The only thing that catered to that was the make-up. Even when The Principle of Evil Made Flesh came out ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ you look at Emperor and Burzum and all that stuff ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ we didn't sound anything like that. The way that I see it is that we were, and still are now, an extreme metal band.\n\n\nVIDEOCLIPS\n\n.Dusk and Her Embrace\n.From the Cradle to Enslave(uncensored)\n.Her Ghost in the Fog\n.Temptation\n.The Forest Whispers my Name\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a94abf6d37bc9480f58b3f5bd10417b9d3f2e17","amp;dn":"Cradle+of+Filth+-+5+Videoclips+%7BBlasphemy%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a94abf6d37bc9480f58b3f5bd10417b9d3f2e17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,148,171,246,211,123,201,72,15,88,179,245,189,16,65,123,157,63,46,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
