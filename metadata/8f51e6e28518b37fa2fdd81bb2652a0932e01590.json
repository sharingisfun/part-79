Bernal World Scientific Conference on Security and Disarmament (1988) at the World Trade Center, NY.\n\nFeatured are stunning revelations about the Soviet time-reversed electrogravitation weapons, their deployment and use, the true story of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, Kaznacheyev death photons, Priore and much, much more.  And over 20 years later after Tom Bearden gave this lecture, none of these weapons systems have just ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgone away,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and it is no longer just the Russians that are ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe bad guys.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nUpdated and digitally re-mastered in 2010 with almost an hour of contemporary news footage and archived historical video.\n\nAlso available in PAL format for the first time.\n\n90 min. - DVD video\nPlus 30 additional minutes of Special Features\n\nATTENTION: For those that respect the work of Tom Bearden and have benefited from his books and videos that have been digitized and made available for free online, please consider buying the original copies from his website or donating directly (via PayPal) to his research:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cheniere.org/sales/online-store.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cheniere.org/sales/online-store.htm&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f51e6e28518b37fa2fdd81bb2652a0932e01590","amp;dn":"Secret+Super+Weapons+that+Drive+Disarmament+Negotiations+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f51e6e28518b37fa2fdd81bb2652a0932e01590","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,81,230,226,133,24,179,127,162,253,216,27,178,101,42,9,50,224,21,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
