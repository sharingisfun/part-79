Gets rid of the annoying logo ads when the game starts.\n\nCut all the LOGO's and shortened one of the opening vid's, no good stuff missing though.\n\nCopy these files into the NecroVisionDataMovies folder.\n(in case this doesnt show the backslashes, find the &quot;NecroVision&quot; folder then the &quot;Data&quot; folder then the &quot;Movies&quot; folder and unzip this in there)\n\nThis file contains 3 of the ad logos that drag the starting of the game out to a couple of minutes, but not now.\n\nStart the game and wala! go right to the game!!! \n\nThis file is zipped up, so download and just unzip it in that folder!\n\nBe watching for more for other games as over the next few days I will be releasing a \nbunch more of these.\n\n(Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯`Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¸Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¸.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯`Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·-=BeDLaM=- @ TiMeS2 FxPÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â·Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯`Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¸Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¸.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/t2BeDLaM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/t2BeDLaM&lt;/a&gt;\nfor my other ad removal intro's!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec29b18acf13fdcb6c8529892650318feae6701a","amp;dn":"NecroVision+Logo+Intro+File+replacement.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec29b18acf13fdcb6c8529892650318feae6701a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,41,177,138,207,19,253,203,108,133,41,137,38,80,49,143,234,230,112,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
