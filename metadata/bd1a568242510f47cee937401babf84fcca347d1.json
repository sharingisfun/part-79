Next with &quot;Crazy for the Boys&quot; and &quot;I Should Have Said I Love You&quot;. Finally, must-listen &quot;Supernatural&quot;.\n\nEnjoy music and seed for it, people!\n\n(Other info: Written by BunnyFooFoo\nHuckapoo is a fabricated Girl Group created by the people behind Dreamstreet. They have appeared on various Disney complications, and have toured around the New York City area.\n\nThis CD was supposed to be released, however, the band broke-up after Angel Sparks left to pursue an education. Some of these songs are from their EP (I got it at their concert) the others are from Soundtracks they've appeared on.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd1a568242510f47cee937401babf84fcca347d1","amp;dn":"Huckapoo+-+Huckapoo+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd1a568242510f47cee937401babf84fcca347d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,26,86,130,66,81,15,71,206,233,55,64,27,171,248,79,204,163,71,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
