The actual genre of this music would be hard to define as any sort of rock, as the music shifts from operatic to dance to hip hop to folk, all while keeping its feet firmly on the path through the Forbidden Forest.\n\nThe journey, clocking in under a half hour, focuses on many side characters, including a love song for Luna, something I can only assume is about dementors, and a strangely bittersweet funeral dirge for someone named Tom. The whole thing ends up coming off as strangely, and quite effectively, personal.\n\nA highly rewarding album, for anyone, Harry Potter fan or not. \n\n\n\n1. I Open at the Close\n2. Get Your Hallows Up\n3. The Riddle That is Tom\n4. Song for Luna\n5. We Eat Our Young\n6. Song for Neville\n7. Sever Us\n\nAll songs are high quality lossless MP3's.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ede1a76487bd72b149d469800f135313f50eace","amp;dn":"The+Sorting+Hat+-+The+Hallows+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ede1a76487bd72b149d469800f135313f50eace","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,222,26,118,72,123,215,43,20,157,70,152,0,241,53,49,63,80,234,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
