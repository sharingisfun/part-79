John Legend - Heartbreaker [2009][GOLDFiSH_XviD]\n*************************************************************\n\nThe song Heartbreaker is from the album 'Fist Of God' from MSTRKRFT.\nInitial critical response to Fist of God was very average. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 57, based on 18 reviews. Jesse F. Keeler told ClashMusic.com that he expected the mixed reception.\n\nI expect a lot of people to not like the record, but I expect a lot more people to like the record now that weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve reached a way bigger audience making it. It might sound like a calculated business move, but it was mainly a musical thing. We kinda knew what the reactionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d be, and we even told a lot of the kids on the message boards: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Well, a lot of you are gonna hate itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s difficult, too, you know, because a lot of people have just discovered us, and theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re going to go on this record initially; but we didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want to make a record that was too ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“nowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. We could have got a lot of the rappers - like The Cool Kids, Spank Rock and Kid Sister - but we tried to choose things and people that were more timeless. And, anyway, I love bad reviews, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re my favourite things.\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\nVideo\n-----\nPDTV rip using a capture card of the BBC's 'Muse Live From Teignmouth'...\n\n\nVideo Format     - AVI (container) / XviD (codec)\nVideo Quality    - ~2100kbps\nVideo Resolution - 1008 x 576\nFrame Rate       - 30 fps\n   \nSound Quality    - 192kbps\nSound Channels   - 2 (stereo)\n\n\nSeed, enjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96828ed3aa98180b510a3bbc9c802a4e04983401","amp;dn":"MSTRKRFT+Ft.+John+Legend+-+Heartbreaker+%5B2009%5D%5BGOLDFiSH_XviD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96828ed3aa98180b510a3bbc9c802a4e04983401","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,130,142,211,170,152,24,11,81,10,59,188,156,128,42,78,4,152,52,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
