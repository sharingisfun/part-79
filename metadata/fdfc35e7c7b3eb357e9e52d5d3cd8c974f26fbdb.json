She plays her own instruments for her songs, programs her own electronic beats, and produces her own albums.\n\nShe released her first album, Fancypants Hoodlum, under the name Merrill Nisker in 1995, and subsequently developed the style and persona that would take her to international fame as Peaches. In Toronto, before rising to fame, she was a roommate of fellow recording artist Feist.\n\nHer songs have been featured in movies such as Mean Girls, Waiting..., Jackass Number Two, My Little Eye, and Lost in Translation. Her music has also been featured on television shows such as Showtime's The L Word and Ugly Betty, and has been used for the promotion of Dirt. Peaches performed guest vocals on Pink's album Try This, on the song &quot;Oh My God,&quot; and on the Chicks on Speed album 99 Cents, on the song &quot;We Don't Play Guitars.&quot;\n\nFor her fourth album, 2006's Impeach My Bush, Peaches enlisted guest musicians Joan Jett, Greg Kurstin, Josh Homme, Samantha Maloney, Beth Ditto, Feist, Dave Catching, Brian O'Connor and Radio Sloan to perform on several of the tracks.\n\n \nPeaches and the Herms performing in 2006.
