Turn up the Night is as intense and brutal as Neon Knights; The Sign of the Southern Cross and Falling off the Edge of the World are from the same loud-quiet-loud school as Die Young, Children of the Sea and Heaven and Hell. Ultimately, this album is marginally less satisfying than its predecessor, but still towers over everything any of its perpetrators have done since.\n\nThis 2010 remaster is a must-have, featuring extras that I personally crawled over hot coals to get over the years - in particular the live version of Die Young that appeared as the b-side to The Mob Rules single and the full Live at Hammersmith CD that I spent a small fortune personally importing on release. All are outstanding - Live at Hammersmith has an energy and edge that I find lacking from Live Evil - as well as a setlist featuring more Dio era material. Die Young, along with final extra The Mob Rules demo, is raw, raucous and unpolished - and is all the more exciting for that. As with Heaven &amp; Hell (Deluxe Edition), the 2010 remaster is quieter than the 2004 Sanctuary release, however this is easily solved by just turning up the volume.\n\nNow all they need to do is unearth recordings of the Heaven and Hell rehearsals featuring Ozzy and I can die a happy man! \n\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b793fe8b1fb230fd7a2310495135485638870bd","amp;dn":"Black+Sabbath-Mob+Rules-Remastered-2CD-2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b793fe8b1fb230fd7a2310495135485638870bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,121,63,232,177,251,35,15,215,162,49,4,149,19,84,133,99,136,112,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
