Starring and co-created by Patrick McGoohan, it combined spy fiction with elements of science fiction, allegory, and psychological drama.\n\nThe series follows a British former secret agent who is held prisoner in a mysterious seaside village where his captors try to find out why he abruptly resigned from his job. Although sold as a thriller in the mould of McGoohan's previous series, Danger Man (called Secret Agent in its U.S. release), the show's combination of 1960s countercultural themes and surreal setting had a far-reaching effect on science fiction/fantasy programming, and on popular culture in general.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prisoner&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prisoner&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThese are the whole 'The Prisoner' TV series encoded for PSP and hardsubbed in English. Specially for those who want to enjoy these classic series and either watch TV in noisy environment or have a hard time understanding what characters say.\nDocumentaries and trailers are not subtitled.\n\nOrder of episodes 1-5 and 16-17 is the order recommended by Patrick McGoohan; episodes 6-15 order is how Scott Apel arranged them for KTEH/PBS. Thanks to Slashdot users 598415 and 1631005 for their recommendations.\n\nSource: 40th Anniversary Special Edition DVD rips by drmatt on ThePirateBay, http://thepiratebay.se/search/prisoner%20special/0/2/200\n\n384x272, 512+80 kbps. Audio is in mono (because remastered 5.1 sounds awful).\nTested on PSP, but probably should work with iPhone/Zune.\nEncoded with MeGUI/x264/neroAac.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da390ba29c82c3e52a13c8a10c597421254ed585","amp;dn":"The+Prisoner+%5BPSP%5D%5BEngSub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da390ba29c82c3e52a13c8a10c597421254ed585","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,57,11,162,156,130,195,229,42,19,200,161,12,89,116,33,37,78,213,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
