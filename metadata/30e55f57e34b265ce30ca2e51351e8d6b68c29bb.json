The song is essentially a cover of Irish rock band Relish's Rainbow Zephyr but with a slightly changed set of lyrics and a different song title.\n\nThe next single was a cover of the Barry Manilow hit, &quot;Mandy&quot;. The band's version was an instant hit, earning them their 12th UK number one and an Irish record of the year award.\n\n&quot;Obvious&quot;, an original song, was the third and final single released from this album.\n\n&quot;Turnaround&quot; was the last album to feature former band member Bryan McFadden.\n\nThe album was the 23rd best selling of 2003 in the UK.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Mandy\n[02] Hey Whatever\n[03] Heal\n[04] Obvious\n[05] When A Woman Loves A Man\n[06] On My Shoulder\n[07] Turn Around\n[08] I Did It For You\n[09] Thank You\n[10] To Be With You\n[11] Home\n[12] Lost In You\n[13] What Do They Know\n \n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 00h:47m:24s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 116mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v8.2.1.6 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop\n\nOriginally Released\t- 24 November 2003\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Sony BMG\n\nArtists Website\t\t- http://www.westlife.com \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://www.bebo.com/westlife \n\t\t\t-\n\n\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n\n===================================================================================\n\nMandy [CDS] - Westlife [2003]\n\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Mandy\n[02] You See Friends (I See Lovers)\n[03] Greased Lightin'\n \n\nMusic Videos \n\n[01] Mandy\n[02] Mandy; The Making Of The Video\n\n===================================================================================\n\nTonight [CDS] - Westlife [2003]\n\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Tonight (Single Remix)\n[02] Miss You Nights (Single Remix)\n[03] Where We Belong\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30e55f57e34b265ce30ca2e51351e8d6b68c29bb","amp;dn":"%5B2003%5D+Turnaround+-+Westlife+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30e55f57e34b265ce30ca2e51351e8d6b68c29bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,229,95,87,227,75,38,92,227,12,162,229,19,81,232,214,182,140,41,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
