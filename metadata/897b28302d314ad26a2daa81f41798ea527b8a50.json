It's what makes Workers a huge and\nfine rock alternative beast. Instantly obvious with album opener, &quot;Revolutions&quot;,\nLouisville, KY's Workers make brassy arena-able rock with a frontman that sounds\njust as huge as the instruments that sound behind him. JohnsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s handsome\nwailing compliments the whammy riffage of tracks like &quot;Invitation&quot;, but that's\nonly one faucet.\n\nUp until track four, titled &quot;Trinidad &amp; Tobago&quot;, it's easy to (affectionately)\nthrow Workers into to same category as bands like U2, Keane and Coldplay, but a\nMy Bloody Valentine reference? Seems a little left field, huh? Not that the\ncrossover is far-fetched - shoegaze (the band compares themselves to The Jesus\nand Mary Chain) and arena rock both make big ass music - but to see a band (and\na relatively unknown one at that) do such with such ease, conviction and\npersonality is just comfy. Granted, &quot;Trinidad &amp; Tobago&quot; (or other droners\n&quot;Funeral&quot; and &quot;Circulation&quot;) is less illustrated than anything on Isn't\nAnything, but the fuzzy atmosphere of feedback and distortion is at the\nforefront. Even more exciting is &quot;Human Resources&quot;, a strutting indie-popish\nnumber with a chorus-hook combo that's bouncy and memorable, and yet it's still\nWorkers.\n\nThe few tracks that don't capture the band's agility for flexing, pulling from\nand drawing close big-rock genres aren't blemishes, but they mess with the flow\nthat's been flowing so well. Steam is lost with hesitating hipster joint &quot;French\nFigure 8&quot; and then follower, &quot;Funeral&quot;. No matter - the album's partly acoustic\nslow track &quot;A Heartbeat&quot; is a break in tempo that refocuses Workers' shtick.\nWhen stripped down to just a (literal) heartbeat and honeyed coos, the song is\nsimple and captivating. What does pimple pock the album's stately vibe are the\nlyrics, which are - at best - too basic and meaningless when sitting pretty next\nto their sonic parents. Thankfully, all that distortion drowns out the boring\nlines that rhyme too much until later listens, but this compromises the album's\nlasting value.\n\nThis isn't a new band. Formerly known as Your Black Star, Workers is the\nrejuvenated version of the same group. Three previous releases - starting from a\nsplit EP in 2004 - to make up their disco, and it takes a name change to get an\ninspired Workers. The difference between what happened then and what we hear now\nis almost right. Workers has the fluidity of effects, Johnson's Bono firmness\nand silken production coming together as a whole. Almost there.\n\n\nRIYL: Coldplay, Keane, Muse, U2, The Killers\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:897b28302d314ad26a2daa81f41798ea527b8a50","amp;dn":"Workers-Workers-2009-RTB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"897b28302d314ad26a2daa81f41798ea527b8a50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,123,40,48,45,49,74,210,106,45,170,129,244,23,152,234,82,123,138,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
