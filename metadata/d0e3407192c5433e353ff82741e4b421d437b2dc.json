Steve and his nerves-of-steel sidekick wife, Terri, are asked to relocate a cattle-chomping crocodile before it's shot by a local rancher. This same reptile happened to swallow the intelligence-gathering device that fell to earth, and so begins the goofball premise of this lark of a movie.\n\nThe feds believe the Irwins are appropriating their classified info, and the Irwins think they're running from poachers. Quibblers may object to Irwin's frequent interruptions to introduce a bird-eating spider or paw through croc dung, but Crocodile Hunter fans wouldn't have it any other way. This 89-minute film is rated PG for action violence/peril and mild language. But unless you consider &quot;crikey&quot; an obscenity, it's a safe bet for family viewing. \n\n\n\nSteve Irwin makes his big-screen debut with his most perilous adventure yet! To save a very large crocodile from poachers, Steve and his wife Terri set out on a death-defying journey through the Outback to nab the big fella and relocate him to a safe river. But what they don't know is that the angry reptile has swallowed a top-secret US satellite beacon making them all targets of American special agents! Crikey! \n\n\n\n\n\nDirected by: John Stainton\n==========================\n\n\nWritten by: John Stainton &amp; Holly Goldberg Sloan\n================================================\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    The Crocodile Hunter:Collision Course\nYear.................:    2002\nGenre................:    Action /Adventure/Comedy/Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    01:29:13\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    138 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    MPEG Layer-3\nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    640x272\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    1091 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    English\nFile Size:...........:    695 MB\nFPS..................:    23.976000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    12 July 2002\n\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0305396/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0305396/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at this link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n \n                          **** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            IN MEMORY OF STEVE IRWIN\n\n                             22/2-1962----04/09-2006\n\n\nSteve Irvin:  &quot;If its one thing that, i....
