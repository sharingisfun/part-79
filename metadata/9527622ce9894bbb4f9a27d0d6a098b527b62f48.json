Yeah, that was Music Box of course! Remember those veejays: Simon Potter, Gaz Top, Martin Buchanan, Suny, etc.?\nThis is one of the few memento's I still have. It was copied from videotape, so the quality is not as excellent as I would have wished.\nYou'll see videoclips from: Dream Acamedy, Spandau Ballet, Wham, Duran Duran, the Weather Girls, Will Powers, Marilyn, the Cult and more, with bloopers in between from your favorite popstars of the eighties and the veejays. Enjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9527622ce9894bbb4f9a27d0d6a098b527b62f48","amp;dn":"MusicBox.Bloopers.eighties","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9527622ce9894bbb4f9a27d0d6a098b527b62f48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,39,98,44,233,137,75,187,79,154,39,208,214,160,152,181,39,182,47,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
