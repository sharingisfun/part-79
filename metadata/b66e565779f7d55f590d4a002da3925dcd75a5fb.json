But while nothing here packs quite the punch\n that &quot;How Much More,&quot; &quot;We Got the Beat,&quot; and &quot;Turn to You&quot; did, such memorable\n songs as &quot;Heaven Is a Place on Earth,&quot; &quot;Should I Let You In?,&quot; and\n &quot;I Get Weak&quot; show that the Angelino still had plenty of spirit.\n &quot;Circle in the Sand&quot; is in fact a gem -- a haunting Shangri-Las-like song\n with an early-to-mid-'60s-ish quality that makes you wish you were back\n in the Summer of '64 on your way to the beach. If one were to own only one\n solo effort from Carlisle's MCA years, this would be the best choice.\n ~ Alex Henderson, All Music Guide \n\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEnjoy our releases and help us with sharing, please.\n\n\n\nPeak level 100.0 %\n     Track quality 100.0 %\n     Test CRC 25DCE54E\n     Copy CRC 25DCE54E\n     Accurately ripped (confidence 14)  [9A06486E]\n     Copy OK\n\n\n\nAll tracks accurately ripped\n\nNo errors occurred\n\nEnd of status report\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b66e565779f7d55f590d4a002da3925dcd75a5fb","amp;dn":"Belinda+Carlisle+-+Heaven+On+Earth+%281987%29%5BEac+Flac+Cue%5D%5BRock+Cit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b66e565779f7d55f590d4a002da3925dcd75a5fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,110,86,87,121,247,213,95,89,13,74,0,45,163,146,93,205,117,165,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
