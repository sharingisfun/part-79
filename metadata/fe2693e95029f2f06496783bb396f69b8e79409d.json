Wrapping up singles A to M alongside a host of\nbonus material, the compilation illustrates Ash rejuvenated creative\nzeal.\n\nCurrently back in their Manhattan HQ recording tracks which will\ncomplete the second half of the series, Ash have been spurred on by the\nunique challenge of a singles only future. The scrutiny of each track\nbeing drip-fed to fans, juxtaposed by freedom from the traditional\n2-year album cycle, has fostered a new Ash era of diverse, imaginative\npop.\n\nWhile the rock electro hybrids True Love 1980 and Space Shot have\nbroken through to the airwaves, the consistent quality of the series is\nbacked up by the varied and original song writing on the tracks in\nbetween. The 3-minute gem Ichiban, the expansive dynamic rock of Joy\nKicks Darkness, the classic Wheeler love song Tracers and the\natmospheric tale of humanity lost Pripyat are amongst the bands\nresponses to the creative everest that is a 26 single campaign.\n\nRetail version including 5 extra tracks.
