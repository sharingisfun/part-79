On July 3, the song replaced &quot;Boom Boom Pow&quot; at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, giving the group its second U.S. chart-topper. \n\nBillboard gave the song a positive review: &quot;The Black Eyed Peas proved with their massive international chart-topper &quot;Boom Boom Pow&quot; that they're a group still to be reckoned with. The official follow-up single &quot;I Gotta Feeling&quot; may be their most mainstream release yet.\n\nThe song has so far sold 1,547,000 digital downloads in the United States.[12] &quot;I Gotta Feeling&quot; ended the 12 week number-one run of the band's previous single &quot;Boom Boom Pow&quot;, when it reached number one on the Hot 100 the chart week of July 11, 2009, their second single to do so. It makes the band only the fourth group to replace themselves at number one in the chart's history, following The Beatles, Boyz II Men, and Outkast, and the first to do it in the digital download era. &quot;I Gotta Feeling&quot; has remained #1 on the Hot 100 for five weeks so far, extending the band's run at number one on the Hot 100 to seventeen consecutive weeks. Black Eyed Peas have now stayed four months on top the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.\n\nReleased \tJune 1, 2009 (Australia- Radio)\n\t\tJune 9, 2009 (U.S. - Digital)\n\t\tJune 16, 2009 (U.S. - Radio)[1]\n\t\tJuly 10, 2009 (Australia)[2]\n\t\tAugust 10, 2009 (UK - Physical)[3]\nFormat \t\tDigital download\nRecorded \t2008\nGenre \t\tDance-pop, Electro house\nLength \t\t4:49 (Album) 4:05 (Radio)\nWriter(s) \tWilliam Adams, Allen Pineda, Jaime Gomez, Stacy Ferguson, David Guetta\nProducer \tDavid Guetta\nCertification \tGold (RIANZ)\n\nVideo Specs :\n\nFormat: Matroska (.mkv) | AVC\nNominal Bitrate: 3 064kbps\nOverall Bitrate: 3 233 kbps\nEncoding: 2 Pass [Extreme]\nResolution: 1280 x 720\nQuality Factor: 0.133\nFrame Rate: 25.000 fps\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 16/9\nDuration: 4mn 49s\n\nAudio Specs :\n\nType: Vorbis\nBitrate Mode: Variable\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\nChannels: 2 channels\n\nBest Player: KMPlayer\n\nDon't Forget to say a little 'Thank You' and lots of SEEDs! :]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b52c5c79297c7191944bc74703955439286d320","amp;dn":"I+Gotta+Feeling+-+Black+Eyed+Peas+2009+720p+chikezei","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b52c5c79297c7191944bc74703955439286d320","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,82,197,199,146,151,199,25,25,68,188,116,112,57,85,67,146,134,211,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
