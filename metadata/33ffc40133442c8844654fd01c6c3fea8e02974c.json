Glenn Hughes, ex-Deep Purple bassist and vocalist, was lead singer but did not play bass on this release.\n\nAs this album was not originally intended to be a Black Sabbath record, its sound is drastically different from previous releases. Many of the songs have a very bluesy feel, and it is notably less heavy than its predecessor, Born Again. Seventh Star was the first album to feature longtime keyboardist Geoff Nicholls as an official band member.\n\nThe promo-single and video version of &quot;No Stranger to Love&quot; had additional harmony vocals added by Hughes to make it more &quot;radio-friendly&quot;. Actress Denise Crosby, who would later portray Tasha Yar in Star Trek: The Next Generation was in the video.\n\nThere was a tour for the album, but Hughes only performed at the first few shows. His voice had noticeably deteriorated after a fight with Sabbath's Production manager had left the singer with an injury to his sinuses and throat. Heavy cocaine use also contributed to his inability to properly perform live. At the band's early 1986 Detroit concert, Hughes' voice had deteriorated to the point where keyboardist Geoff Nicholls provided &quot;ghost&quot; vocals from backstage and had Hughes lipsynch along. Due to Hughes' inability to sing properly, he was sometimes omitting entire verses of songs. Hughes was sacked thereafter and replaced by Ray Gillen, who completed both the North American and European legs of the tour, though several dates in the US were cancelled.\n\nGlenn Hughes has performed &quot;No Stranger to Love&quot; at some of his live concerts.\n\nIt peaked at number 78 on the Billboard 200 chart.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33ffc40133442c8844654fd01c6c3fea8e02974c","amp;dn":"Black+Sabbath+and+Tony+Iommi+-+No+Stranger+To+Love","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33ffc40133442c8844654fd01c6c3fea8e02974c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,255,196,1,51,68,44,136,68,101,79,208,28,108,63,234,142,2,151,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
