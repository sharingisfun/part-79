Reunited with his estranged father, Talbot sets out to find his brother... and discovers a horrifying destiny for himself. Talbot's childhood ended the night his mother died. After he left the sleepy Victorian hamlet of Blackmoor, he spent decades recovering and trying to forget. But when his brother's fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e, Gwen Conliffe, tracks him down to help find her missing love, Talbot returns home to join the search. He learns that something with brute strength and insatiable bloodlust has been killing the villagers, and that a suspicious Scotland Yard inspector named Aberline has come to investigate.\n\n\nSCREENSHOTS: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/maMFmaacn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/maMFmaacn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MAmFOAaCn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MAmFOAaCn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/nAmFaaaCn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/nAmFaaaCn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/namFCAacN&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/namFCAacN&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nCast \nSimon Merrells\t... \tBen Talbot\nGemma Whelan\t... \tGwen's Maid\nEmily Blunt\t... \tGwen Conliffe\nBenicio Del Toro\t... \tLawrence Talbot\nMario Marin-Borquez\t... \tYoung Lawrence\nAsa Butterfield\t... \tYoung Ben\nCristina Contes\t... \tSolana Talbot\nAnthony Hopkins\t... \tSir John Talbot\nArt Malik\t... \tSingh\nMalcolm Scates\t... \tButcher\nNicholas Day\t... \tColonel Montford\nMichael Cronin\t... \tDr. Lloyd\n\n\nThe Wolfman (2010) DVDRiP (MP4) For PSP, IpOD, Zune (www.PlayStationPortable.DarkBB.Com)\n\nvisit our forum\n\n\nwww . amz . 321 . cn\n\nor\n\nwww . playstationportable . darkbb . com  (without space)\n\n\n\n\nPLEASE SEED AND LEAVE A COMMENT!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c1c8ae5c77266a5c3166ebe5e69f42fb8a6c00f","amp;dn":"The+Wolfman+%282010%29+DVDRiP+%28MP4%29+For+PSP%2C+IpOD%2C+Zune+%28www.PlaySta","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c1c8ae5c77266a5c3166ebe5e69f42fb8a6c00f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,28,138,229,199,114,102,165,195,22,110,190,94,105,244,47,184,166,192,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
