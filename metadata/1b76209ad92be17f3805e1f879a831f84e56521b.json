It is important to realize that these people have been tricked into placing their trust in an organization that claims to be GodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sole channel of communication on earth. According to the Watchtower Society, they are the sole source of correct Bible interpretation. \n\nThe Watchtower Library 2009 contains all the books, magazines, brochures and other materials published by the Watchtower Society since 1970.\n\nUnpack, install and study the twisted nature of their beliefs.\n\nAnd remember to pray for them, because they are lost souls in spiritual bondage.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b76209ad92be17f3805e1f879a831f84e56521b","amp;dn":"Watchtower+Library+2009+-+English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b76209ad92be17f3805e1f879a831f84e56521b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,118,32,154,217,43,225,127,56,5,225,248,121,168,49,248,78,86,82,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
