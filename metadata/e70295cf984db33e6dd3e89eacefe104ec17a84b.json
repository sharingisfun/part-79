Travis finds himself at the bottom of the UAA (United Assassins Association) rankings and must wage war to become the No. 1 assassin once again. The follow-up to the popular No More Heroes will offer fans infectious, fun gameplay that allows you to wield not just one, but two swords and face multiple bosses simultaneously in bigger-than-ever boss battles. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e70295cf984db33e6dd3e89eacefe104ec17a84b","amp;dn":"No+more+Heroes+2+ISO-wii","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e70295cf984db33e6dd3e89eacefe104ec17a84b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,2,149,207,152,77,179,62,109,211,232,158,172,239,225,4,236,23,168,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
