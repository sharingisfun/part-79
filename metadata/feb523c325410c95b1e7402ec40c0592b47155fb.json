Funniest part is when George says, &quot;Let me put on my reading glasses&quot; so he can see the nuts up close haha.\n\nJudd Apatow and Seth Rogen stop by to promote their new movie &quot;Funny People&quot;.  They discuss the &quot;Entourage&quot; episode where the crew insults Seth by saying he's an ugly fat guy who only gets laid because he's funny.  Judd and Seth say &quot;Fuck You Entourage&quot;.  Classic.  This was a VERY good interview.  Seth stays for the &quot;Wheel Of Sex&quot; which ends up failing because the dumb whores won't play the game!  Fun stuff.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:feb523c325410c95b1e7402ec40c0592b47155fb","amp;dn":"Howard+TV+-+Judd+Apatow+%26+Seth+Rogen+07-30-09%28wush%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"feb523c325410c95b1e7402ec40c0592b47155fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,181,35,195,37,65,12,149,177,231,64,46,196,12,5,146,180,113,85,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
