Boris Zaroff is a modern businessman who\n               is haunted by his past -- his father was\n               the notorious Count Zaroff of The Most\n               Dangerous Game fame. Consequently, Boris\n               is subject to hallucinations and\n               all-too-real social lapses which normally\n               involve sadistic harm to beautiful naked\n               young women. His butler is sworn to\n               indoctrinating him into the evils of the\n               family line, and their castle's torture\n               dungeon proves quite useful in this\n               regard. However, Boris is periodically\n               lured away from his destiny by the\n               romantic apparition of the deceased\n               countess who previously owned the castle.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08653d114b9859b86f31dca82c496512d410fccd","amp;dn":"Seven.Women.For.Satan.1976.DVDRip.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08653d114b9859b86f31dca82c496512d410fccd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,101,61,17,75,152,89,184,111,49,220,168,44,73,101,18,212,16,252,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
