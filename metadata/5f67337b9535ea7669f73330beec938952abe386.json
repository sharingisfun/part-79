Wrong! Being a fan of that movie, I picked up this book expecting some minor discrepancies, but was amazed to find a story that had practically nothing in common with the movie. \n\nThis is the story of Carey, Charles and Paul Wilson who, while staying with their aunt in Bedfordshire, suddenly discover that a neighbor, Miss Price is a witch! Not your stereotypical witch, Miss Price is a prim and proper lady who is willing to buy the children's silence with the gift of a magic bed knob that will allow the children to travel through space and time. Seeking to visit their mother, the children find themselves scooped up by the London police. Next, Miss Price takes them to an isolated tropical island, only to discover that cannibals inhabit the island. Their final adventure takes them to Restoration England, where they meet a forlorn (and inept) necromancer, Emelius Jones. \n\nThis story (actually two books combined into one) is quite charming. In a gentle and freewheeling fashion, Mary Norton draws the reader along on a fantastic adventure.\n\n\n\nMary Norton - Read by Patricia Hodge\n\nBedknob And Broomstick - 01 of 10\nBedknob And Broomstick - 02 of 10\nBedknob And Broomstick - 03 of 10\nBedknob And Broomstick - 04 of 10\nBedknob And Broomstick - 05 of 10\nBedknob And Broomstick - 06 of 10\nBedknob And Broomstick - 07 of 10\nBedknob And Broomstick - 08 of 10\nBedknob And Broomstick - 09 of 10\nBedknob And Broomstick - 10 of 10\n\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration Approx : 13 \nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\n\n\n\n\n.
