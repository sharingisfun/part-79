Players are thrust into the loud and intense experience of racing a car on the edge of control from the driverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s perspective through the combination of perception based G-forces, the hyper reality of the cockpit view, and the brutal experience of a first-person crash dynamic.\nNeed for Speed SHIFT features an accurate, accessible physics-based driving model that allows you to feel every impact, every change of track surface and every last bit of grip as you push yourself to the edge.\nRace your way and stamp your mark on the world, define your style and build your unique driver profile.\nControl\nthe raw power of aggressively tuned race cars. Unrivalled in-car experience and physics deliver the feel of being behind the wheel of a race car.\nCompete against the best drivers in the world online. Your driver profile helps match you against the most suitable rivals for your ability.\nFeatures include:\nTrue DriverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Experience ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ A variety of visual cues delivers the true driverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s experience including a three-dimensional HUD that mimics driver head movement, inertia and G-forces. The depth of field also adjusts based on the speed of the car; so when the car is travelling at high speeds the perspective will shift to the distance putting the car/cockpit out of focus.\nEnhanced AI ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ A sophisticated AI system will mean that your races are more exciting than ever before. AI opponents will react and perform based on the playerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s aggression and overall driving skill thus creating race experiences for all skill sets.\nDynamic Crash Effect - When the player hits a static object or opponent car, the player will feel like they are 'taking damage'. A combination of visual and audio effects will leave the player disorientated and briefly disrupt the race.\nTotal Customisation ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Need for Speed SHIFT features a comprehensive customisation option that lets the player tailor every aspect of the cars performance and styling. Go under the hood to upgrade and tune your vehicle to increase its performance. The visual customisation system allows players to personalise both the exterior and trick out the interior to reflect their individual style and preferences.\nPhoto Real Cars and Tracks ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Nearly 70 licensed cars are available including the Pagani Zonda F, Audi RS4, and Porsche 911 GT3 RSR. There are also over 15 real-world locations like Willow Springs and Laguna Seca as well as fictional circuits like downtown London and Tokyo.\n\nREGION LOCKED NTSC-U AND NTSC-J","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d88ab658d6c871cf9c93035448fba31bdc83b12","amp;dn":"Need+for+speed+shift+NTSC+%28Xbox+360%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d88ab658d6c871cf9c93035448fba31bdc83b12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,136,171,101,141,108,135,28,249,201,48,53,68,143,186,49,189,200,59,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
