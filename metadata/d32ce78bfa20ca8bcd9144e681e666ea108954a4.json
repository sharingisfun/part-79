So don't worry if \nyou can't see any seeds! This allows me to get the film to you QUICKER, as well as more\ndiscreetly.\n___________________\nThis is a PURE DivX release including embedded DivX subs where applicable -\nFor best results, it is strongly recommended to view using the DivX player,\nwhich will also burn a DVD that will play on Home Theater certified DVD players.\n\n[url]http://www.divx.com/en/products/software/windows/divx[/url]..(Windows)\n[url]http://www.divx.com/en/products/software/mac/divx[/url]......(Mac)\n__________________\nThe primary audio on my MiniDVDs is a direct AC3 pass-thru of the Original DVD audio.\nPlease don't ask me to change this. Instead - If you are experiencing excessively\nlow volumes on the PC, that's because the dynamic range of PC audio output is much less\nthan for a DVD. Rather than me hacking the audio, I would recommend you download and install\nAC3Filter by Alexander Vigovsky:\n\n[url]http://www.softpedia.com/developer/Alexander-Vigovsky-11541.html[/url]\n\nThis is an EXCELLENT codec with a settable gain, to boost the volume\nand also gives excellent surround-sound even with 2 speakers (try it with headphones!)\nI have it set to play ALL my audio. Thanks, Alex!\n\nIf that doesn't work, you could always complain to the film studios! lol\n__________________\nIf you ever wondered why I include a file called &quot;folder.jpg&quot; in my releases,\nthen you're not file browsing in thumbnail view! - Try it!!\n[/font]\n__________________\n[i]Be sure to visit [url]http://torrentbucket.com/[/url][/i] \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d32ce78bfa20ca8bcd9144e681e666ea108954a4","amp;dn":"Passengers+%282008%29+DvDrip+%28AC3-5.1%29+-+Ch4cal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d32ce78bfa20ca8bcd9144e681e666ea108954a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,44,231,139,250,32,202,139,205,145,68,230,129,230,102,234,16,137,84,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
