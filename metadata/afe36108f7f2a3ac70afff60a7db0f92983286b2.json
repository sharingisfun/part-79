Governments and big business are fiercely protective of their internal dynamics and increasingly are coming down hard on leakers and whistleblowers. The public though demand and defend their right to know when governments theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve installed are making decisions on their behalf, or the actions of big business impact their lives.\n\nAnd so a group of one-time hackers and activists are trying to build a global truth machine.\n\nThey call it WikiLeaks.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe want to create a system where there is guaranteed free press across the world, the entire world..... that every individual in the world has the ability to publish material that is meaningfulÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\nJULIAN ASSANGE ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ FOUNDER WIKILEAKS\n\nA hesitant, quietly spoken Australian named Julian Assange has become the global face of a nebulous operation with secret computer servers in a number of countries and aspirations to build an information freedom zone ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the leakerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s equivalent of a tax haven ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ in, where else ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Iceland.\n\nWikiLeaks exploded into prominence earlier this year when it released hitherto top secret video of a helicopter gunship strafing and killing more than a dozen people in Baghdad including media covering the war.\n\nThe Wiki-team spent some time stripping the video of any electronic fingerprints that would expose the insiders who leaked it and then launched it on-line under the banner ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Collateral MurderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ replete with damning Orwellian quotes. Critics call this activism not journalism.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThey provided artificial agenda driven context . There was an operation underway in reaction to an ongoing war.
