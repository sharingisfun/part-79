Let There be Light \nMonday 7 August 2006 1.50am-2.50am (Sunday night) \nGreek and Arab scholars, and later Europeans such as Descartes and Newton all tried to understand light to gain a better understanding of God. Episode one shows how much of modern science's origins came from the desire to penetrate the divine nature of light.\n \n\n2. The Light of Reason\nTuesday 8 August 2am-3am (Monday night) \nThe second programme explores the link between the development of practical tools that manipulate light and the emergence of new ideas. For example, Galileo's observation that the sun did not go around the earth, was made with a telescope that had been invented for Venetian soldiers and traders.\n\n\n3. The Stuff of Light\nWednesday 9 August 2am-3am (Tuesday night) \nEpisode three charts the discovery of the true nature of light and its impact on the modern world. All of today's technologies - electricity, mobile communications and our ability to illuminate the world 24 hours a day - stem from unravelling the mystery of light.\n\n\n4. Light, The Universe and Everything\nThursday 10 August 2am-3am (Wednesday night) \nIn the final programme Simon Schaffer finds that as more people were able to manipulate light, the more puzzling and tricky it became. This led to investigations into the strange relationship between light, the eye and the mind, and the development of new technology such as photography and cinema. \n\nApprox. runtime 230min\n\nVcodec:  XviD (2pass MPEG)\nAcodec:  AC3 (2.0 192)\n\nPls. help seed to keep torrent alive","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9051b1e5659ff59c801d97464d6ac10598cd46e","amp;dn":"BBC+Light+Fantastic+XviD+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9051b1e5659ff59c801d97464d6ac10598cd46e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,5,27,30,86,89,255,89,200,1,217,116,100,214,172,16,89,140,212,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
