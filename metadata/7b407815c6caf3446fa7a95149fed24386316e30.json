For the \n\n          first time Hard Bass stroke down at the Gelredome stadium in\n\n          Arnhem. Thousands of hardstyle lovers gathered in the massive\n\n          dome and were presented with the pounding beats of four top \n\n          notch DJ teams who combined their outstanding skills and perfect\n\n          record choice into a mind-blowing result.\n\n\n          The four teams, known as Green, Blue, Yellow and Red, more than\n\n          lived up to expectations; they rocked, and they rocked hard! From\n\n          22:00 PM till 07:00 in the morning it was one big and amazing event\n \n          with the best in hardstyle music, laser &amp; video shows and fireworks.\n \n          And not be forgotten, the massive, spectacular and highly impressive\n\n          LED wall (which had never been seen before on any event in the history\n \n          dance music)!\n\n\n\n          Enjoy!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5136569/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5136569/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b407815c6caf3446fa7a95149fed24386316e30","amp;dn":"HARDBASS+2009+%40+Gelredome+Arnhem+DVD+%5Bhardstyle%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b407815c6caf3446fa7a95149fed24386316e30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,64,120,21,198,202,243,68,111,167,169,81,73,254,210,67,134,49,110,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
