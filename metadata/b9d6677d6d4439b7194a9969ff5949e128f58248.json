The ancient prophecies are unravelled, particularly the prophecy in Daniel 9 on the seventy weeks which pinpoints the exact time of the Messiah's arrival on Earth.\n\nThe study of this prophecy has even been cursed by some theologians who do not wish to acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah.

Every aspect of the sanctuary points to the ministry of the Messiah.\n\nBy a study of all its features, the plan of salvation unfolds before our eyes. In this lecture, the significance of each and every article of furniture in the sanctuary in explained and the depth of meaning unfolded. The sanctuary was not arbitrary. It was a lesson book for all generations. 4. The Mists of Time In Daniel chapter 2, King Nebuchadnezzar has a dream in which he sees a great statue through which is to be revealed the history of the world to the very close of time. The startlingly detailed vision tells us where we are in history and what events are about to occur on Earth.\n\n\n\nI am using a SEED BOX that uploads at rates of 2mb/s per leecher.
