This 3CD set takes on a uniquely stripped down, laid back vibe with an acoustic twist.\n\n\nThis collection features a carefully selected tracklist to provide a sublime listening experience, while its broader outlook has allowed for some truly massive names to sign up. Radiohead, Paul Weller, Dido, Corinne Bailey Rae, Adele; artists performing huge acoustic tracks blend seamlessly with established chilled performers Massive Attack, Air, Moby, Morcheeba and Newton Faulkner. Fresh young talent enhances the mix with MGMT, Lily Allen, Empire Of The Sun, Hot Chip, The XX and so many more.\n\n\nDig deeper and the connoisseur will delight to see the likes of Kings Of Convenience, Finley Quaye, JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© GonzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡lez, Phoenix and Sebastian Tellier. Those yet to discover these gems are in for a treat with the diverse experience the album delivers.\n\n\ntrack listing\n\n      disc 1\n          o 1.

Data from this testing also indicated that some individuals confused 48 kbit/s encoded material with an uncompressed original.\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2147195f801bf84d2b2397b6037893ae09925cde","amp;dn":"Ministry+Of+Sound+Chilled+Acoustic+3cd+For+Ipod+Ipad+Itunes+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2147195f801bf84d2b2397b6037893ae09925cde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,71,25,95,128,27,248,77,43,35,151,182,3,120,147,174,9,146,92,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
