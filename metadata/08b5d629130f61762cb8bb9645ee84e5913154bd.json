They are master manipulators and sound designers. The Sirius Expeditions (1998) is a set of playful and eclectic sound constructions. Godwin and Noya use many methods of sound creation and several unidentifiable vocal samples. They surround those samples with a heavy bassline, hi-tech rhythms, and spacious atmospheres to forge a unique sound. This totally original e-music is way out beyond the beyond. Their cover version of Pink Floyd's 'Fat Old Sun' defies description. This disc will appeal to serious e-music collectors; casual fans will like it, but it is not essential.&quot; ~ Jim Brenholts, All Music Guide \n\nThis exists elsewhere on TPB, but it is not seeded.  If you like this, you may also like this http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5071439/ , as the track 'Pah' is used in it.\n\nApologies for the cover art, but I have not found a better copy and do not possess a scanner.  If you can share better cover art w/me, that would be grand.\n\nAs always, Seed &amp; Enjoy this or any of my other torrents,\n\nNTT","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08b5d629130f61762cb8bb9645ee84e5913154bd","amp;dn":"Dogon%7CThe.Sirius.Expeditions%5B1998%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08b5d629130f61762cb8bb9645ee84e5913154bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,181,214,41,19,15,97,118,44,184,187,150,69,238,132,229,145,49,84,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
