It has a second one full of white, anglo-saxon, rich young men who are so sanctimonious no one can stand them except Dean Wormer. The dean enlists the help of the second frat to get the boys of Delta House off campus. This film gives high-jinks and fooling around a bad name. The dean's plan comes into play just before the homecoming parade to end all parades for all time. \n\nMain Movie++++++++++++++\n+Format-NTSC (USA/R1)\n+Video-Compressed to DVD5 (Single Layer)\n+Audio-English 5.1, English 2.0\n+Subs-English, Spanish, French\n\nMenu+++++++\n+Yes\n              \nExtras/Special Features+++++\n+Yes\n\nRemoved++++++++++++++\n+Nothing\n\nI have also included instructions for editing your DVD's with Elby's CloneDVD2. With this tool you can remove any unwanted junk from your DVD's such as Antipiracy warnings, trailers, and whatever else you may not want. You can also compress your DVD's to DVD-5 (single layer). If you find that I have left something out in the instructions just let me know.\n\nPlease Seed!! More seeders &quot;=&quot; me uploading my next torrent sooner!!!\nDon't forget to say thanks!!!\n\nPS: This is not a djfred release, however I have tagged him so that more people see this and it gets more seeders.  The quality is as good or very close to as good as djfred's releases and like his releases, they will always be NTSC R1 with English audio.  Subs will always very from dvd to dvd.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81381e97f3522d9c5ac0c587d2b6370a7cb7b59c","amp;dn":"Animal+House+%28DSPE%29+NTSC+R1+%281978%29+%5Bctang%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81381e97f3522d9c5ac0c587d2b6370a7cb7b59c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,56,30,151,243,82,45,156,90,192,197,135,210,182,55,10,124,183,181,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
