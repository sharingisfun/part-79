It sounds a bit different than march,\nbut that kinda changes every month anyway :]\n\nThanks go out again to my friend james/fen (see you soon in hedgewars ;)) for another great cover!\n\nNow up to some good news,\n\nA music sideproject between samycze and me is about to start soon.\nIn short terms, a great collaboration with some really fine selections.\nI'll let you know, once I got more news about it ;)\n\nLike always, if you really like some of those tracks/artists here, \nplease don't forget to support them in whatever way you can.\n\nPS: Hint --&gt; (next month = playlist anniversary)\nI'll see with what I can come up there...\n\n*bla bla bla*\n*beep beep beep*\n\n/daK signing out\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n VA - Various Artists - daKradha's Indie Rock Playlist - April 2010\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
