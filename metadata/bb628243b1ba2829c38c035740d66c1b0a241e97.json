The video is highly graphic \nand much better edited than the infamous Traces of Death and the fake Faces Of Death. \nAll the scenes in Terrorists, Killers And Middle-East Wackos are real scenes of death \nand suffering, unlike Faces of Death, most of which had been faked and staged. \n\nThe video  was released in the US on the 21st June 2005, by Bumfights. It was due to \nbe released in the UK but was refused a certificate by the BBFC. The BBFC found that the film\n\n&quot;comprises a compilation of uncontextualised clips showing real killings, executions, \nsuicides, accidents, mutilation and torture (of both humans and animals) and other \ndistressing images. The work presents no journalistic, educational or other justifying \ncontext for the images shown. Rather, the work presents a barrage of sensationalist clips, for \nwhat appears to be the underlying purpose of providing prurient entertainment.&quot;\n\nand that it &quot;invites the viewer to take sadistic pleasure in death&quot; and therefore was not \nsuitable for its release in the UK. They also raised concerns that the film may violate \nthe Obsence Publications Act. [1]\n\nTerrorists, Killers And Middle-East Wackos also features music from, Happy Campers, \nwww.happycampers.org tracks include &quot;Wave the Flags&quot;. The video is not a serious documentary \nand its only purpose is to exploit the scenes shown.    \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb628243b1ba2829c38c035740d66c1b0a241e97","amp;dn":"Terrorists.Killers.and.Middle-East.Wackos.DVDRip.XViD-NanoWhale","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb628243b1ba2829c38c035740d66c1b0a241e97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,98,130,67,177,186,40,41,195,140,3,87,64,214,108,27,10,36,30,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
