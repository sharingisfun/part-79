Sasha lends him keys to the flat for few hours while Rob's working and she's out. Jamie and Sooz have the same idea to use the flat while no one is around not knowing Alex will be there, they steal Rob's keys. As soon as Jamie and Sooz undress, Alex and Mark come in and Jamie and Sooz hide under the bed listening in disgust to what goes on above them. Nicki barges in looking for Sasha and finds Mark in bed. She gets Alex to sign some papers (as witness) that her father gave her, transferring ownership of assets into her name. Jamie and Sooz still hiding overhear Mark speaking on the phone to his girlfriend. Rob returns from work early and throws out Alex and Mark. Sooz sneaks out. Jamie is left hiding in the shower when Sasha comes in and gets all wet as she turns the water on. Later he sneaks out in his underwear. Tomorrow morning Jamie and Sooz take an instant dislike to Mark as they meet him and Al in cafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, but Alex is over the moon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:606dd257ceb6b4877ae10ce1d7ec5a6bce1cbc1f","amp;dn":"As+If+2x04+Alex%5C%27s+POV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"606dd257ceb6b4877ae10ce1d7ec5a6bce1cbc1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,109,210,87,206,182,180,135,122,225,12,225,215,236,90,107,206,28,188,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
