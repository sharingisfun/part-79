Koernke's radio show &quot;The Intelligence Report&quot; will expose the New World Order's plans for global domination. Mark's research has managed to come across actual photographs of one of the FEMA concentration camps located in the United States! Koernke has also figured out and exposed their plans to plant microchips into the bodies of children, to insert barcodes into dollar bills so we can use scanners to find out how much money people have, and to use FEMA to take over the country for the U.N.\n\nMPEG 2.0 layer 3     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://libertytreeradio.4mg.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://libertytreeradio.4mg.com&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.militiaradio.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.militiaradio.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n \n\nAfter the &quot;New World Media Channel&quot; takes over TPB, continue to find my torrents here:\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://isohunt.com/release?poster=InfoCourier&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://isohunt.com/release?poster=InfoCourier&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa2926628176d59facfd19fe899b41908514b3c6","amp;dn":"Nightly+Intelligence+Report+w%2F+Mark+Koernke+-+August+17%2C+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa2926628176d59facfd19fe899b41908514b3c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,41,38,98,129,118,213,159,172,253,25,254,137,155,65,144,133,20,179,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
