Her latest book, Web of Debt, documents the Federal Reserve and &quot;the money trust&quot; and shows how this private cartel has usurped power to create money from the people themselves and how we the people can get it back. Brown is the author of several other books, including Forbidden Medicine, Nature's Pharmacy for Children: Drug Free Alternatives for More Than 160 Childhood Ailments. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.webofdebt.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.webofdebt.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ellenbrown.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ellenbrown.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nAlex talks [2nd half of hour 2, into 1st of hour 3] with investigative journalist Wayne Madsen about Obama administration corruption and the BP Gulf oil scandal. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.waynemadsenreport.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.waynemadsenreport.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Madsen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Madsen&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nAlex covers the latest news and takes a number of calls.\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_torrents_info_PLEASE-READ.txt\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
