His first proper Eon single, \n1988's &quot;Light Colour Sound,&quot; was pushed along by a close friend, Colin Faver, \nwho played the track during his sets for the noted pirate station Kiss FM. Two \nsingles from 1992, &quot;Basket Case&quot; and &quot;Spice&quot; (the latter sampled Dune), \nbecame proper club hits in America as well as Britain, and debut album Void \nDweller was an early full-length success for the dance world.\n\nSeveral tracks on the album had benefitted from collaborations, with Depth \nCharge's J Saul Kane and Peter &quot;Baby&quot; Ford (Loveday returned the favor \nwith production for a track on Ford's Bford9). He also provided remixes for \nBizarre Inc.'s Energique album, then branched out even farther with singles \nfor Ford's Trelik Records (recorded as Minimal Man) and Kane's Electron \nIndustries label. No LPs were forthcoming, but Loveday continued to record \nincreasingly minimal, trance-inspired tracks. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n:: Generated by Music NFO Builder v1.20 - www.nfobuilder.com ::\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b314fb78d428f01601a33c08847ce436c4e95b3e","amp;dn":"Eon+-+Void+Dweller+%281992%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b314fb78d428f01601a33c08847ce436c4e95b3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,20,251,120,212,40,240,22,1,163,60,8,132,124,228,54,196,233,91,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
