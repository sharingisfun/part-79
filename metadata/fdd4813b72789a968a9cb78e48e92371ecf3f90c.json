Her early\nwork in pop and rock music in the 1960s was overshadowed by her struggle with\ndrug abuse in the 1970s. During the first two-thirds of that decade, and with little\nnotice, only two studio albums were produced. After a long commercial absence,\nshe returned late in 1979 with the landmark album, Broken English. FaithfullÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\nsubsequent solo work, often critically acclaimed, has at times been overshadowed\nby her personal history.\n\n\n\n1960's It Girl-turned-arthouse singer, Marianne Faithfull, exudes charm in a\nperformance in front of an intimate audience of friends and fans at LSO St Luke's\nin east London.\n\nA great band accompany her on an eclectic mix of songs from her criticallyacclaimed\ncovers album Easy Come Easy Go, including The Decemberists' The\nCrane Wife 3, Morrissey's Dear God, Please Help Me, Dolly Parton's Down From\nDover and Randy Newman's chilling In Germany Before the War.\n\nThere are also dips into the past, with her first ever live performance of the original\n1960s arrangement of As Tears Go By, plus the early Jagger-Richards song Sister\nMorphine.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://h.imagehost.org/view/0124/Thumbs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://h.imagehost.org/view/0124/Thumbs&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdd4813b72789a968a9cb78e48e92371ecf3f90c","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Sessions+-+Marianne+Faithfull+%5B+x264+-+mp3+-+mkv+%5D+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdd4813b72789a968a9cb78e48e92371ecf3f90c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,212,129,59,114,120,154,150,138,156,183,142,72,233,35,113,236,243,249,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
