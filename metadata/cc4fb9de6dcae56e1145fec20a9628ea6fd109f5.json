It has been compared to Pinocchio and Pygmalion.[4]\n\nThe plot is &quot;inspired by the ideas &amp; lyrics of Fall Out Boy&quot;, especially the song &quot;Tiffany Blews&quot; from the album Folie ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  Deux.[1] The story focuses on the Toymaker, who despite being a brilliant inventor, finds himself in financial trouble. A rich magnate known as the Baron seeks to have a robotic woman companion, but his team of scientists is unable to create one that behaves realistically. The Baron hires the Toymaker to help advance the process, and he creates a new android named Tiffany.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc4fb9de6dcae56e1145fec20a9628ea6fd109f5","amp;dn":"Fall.Out.Toyworks.Vol.1.%5B.jpg.scans%5D.%5BX0.%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc4fb9de6dcae56e1145fec20a9628ea6fd109f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,79,185,222,109,202,229,110,17,69,254,194,10,150,40,234,111,209,9,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
