For Mike, the new life he's staking out seems like a legitimate \nroad to success, but it's short on the thrills and excitement of back room poker \ngames. But when Mike's longtime friend Worm is released from prison, Mike is \nfaced with the high-stakes dilemma of his life: to keep on the straight and \nnarrow, or deal himself back into the world of the Rounders. Rounders also stars \nJohn Malkovich as the seedy Russian card shark Teddy KGB, who runs the biggest \nand most dangerous game in town; John Turturro as Joey Knish, Mike's old-time \npoker mentor, and Martin Landau as Professor Petrovsky, Mike's law school dean. \nAs the stakes rise, each one of these men also deals a hand in Mike's ultimate \nfate.\n\n\n\nCodec..........: H.264\nResolution.....: 1920x1080\nBitrate........: 4.3 Mbps\nFramerate......: 24fps\nAudio..........: AC3 Dolby Digital 5.1CH Surround (448Kbs)\nSubtitles......: None\nExtension......: M2TS\n\n\nPlease if you like the movie PLEASE SEED it so others can enjoy it to.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf735ed7f4c1497a01af7ba1720f99802b47835d","amp;dn":"Rounders.1080p.AC3%28DD%29.5.1ch.Blu-ray.PS3-TEAM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf735ed7f4c1497a01af7ba1720f99802b47835d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,115,94,215,244,193,73,122,1,175,123,161,114,15,153,128,43,71,131,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
