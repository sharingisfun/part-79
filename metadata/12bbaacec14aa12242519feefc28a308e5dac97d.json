That said, meet Col. Parker, the offspring of ex-Guns N' Roses guitar-slinger Gilby Clarke, Stray Cats drummer Slim Jim Phantom, one-time L.A. Guns bassist Muddy Stardust and keyboard mercenary, Teddy Andreadis. Rock 'n' Roll Music offers an upbeat mix of blues-based rockers and ballads punctuated with Clarke's inspiring attempts to squeeze every Keith Richards guitar riff into one album, and spiked with humorous odes to decadent lifestyles long-abandoned (&quot;Can't Get that Stuff,&quot; &quot;Pushing 40 Blues&quot;. The disc, which belies the band's bar-band roots, contains zero percent threats to the status quo or insights to the meaning of life. It's only Rock 'n' Roll, but I like it.\nGAIL WORLEY\n(October 22, 2001)Rolling Stone Magazine.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;\n&quot;Something for everyone&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12bbaacec14aa12242519feefc28a308e5dac97d","amp;dn":"Col.+Parker+-+Rock+n+Roll+Music+-+Flac+-+Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12bbaacec14aa12242519feefc28a308e5dac97d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,187,170,206,193,74,161,34,66,81,159,238,252,40,163,8,229,218,201,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
