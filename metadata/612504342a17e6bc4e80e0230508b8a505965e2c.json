Combines black and white humour with moments of drama, poignancy and drunkenness. In series 1, the lads head to Germany seeking work, and are thrown together by virtue of shared nationality and a run-down wooden hut. The story follows the lads' relationships with women, Germans and each other, and their attempts at passing the time away from home, saving money and ordering food in a German curry house. The series ends with new employment legislation forcing some of the Brits having to choose between the UK and their new-found pleasures abroad.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:612504342a17e6bc4e80e0230508b8a505965e2c","amp;dn":"Auf+Wiedersehen+Pet+-+Season+One","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"612504342a17e6bc4e80e0230508b8a505965e2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,37,4,52,42,23,230,188,78,128,224,35,5,8,184,165,5,150,94,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
