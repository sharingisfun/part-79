However, unlike in 2004, there will be four big sections over the last thirty kilometres, to avoid huge gaps opening up and also to provide a more exciting finish. In total, there will be 13.2 kilometres of cobbles. Some riders have difficulty negotiating them and there is always the possibility of punctures or falls... This stage will frighten everyone and the race favourites may lose precious minutes. This Ã¢â‚¬Å“genuine classicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ may be favourable to riders like Armstrong or Evans. And letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not forget that there are some teams who will, on the face of it, not have a role to play in the general standings, such as Quick Step, and who will have a stake in creating all sorts of chaosÃ¢â‚¬Â¦","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df66b764245bad7436a5e85be1b4b4cc6291ac7d","amp;dn":"2010+Tour+De+France+%28in+HD%29+-+Stage+3+-+2010-07-06+%28Cycling%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df66b764245bad7436a5e85be1b4b4cc6291ac7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,102,183,100,36,91,173,116,54,165,232,91,225,180,180,204,98,145,172,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
