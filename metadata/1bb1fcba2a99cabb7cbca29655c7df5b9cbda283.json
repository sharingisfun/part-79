Good luck to all your favourites!\n\nThis recording was made from digital cable through S-cable, then reprocessed to 720x480 Xvid from its original *.MPG\n\nI will not bother posting the original higher quality *.MPGs this time, as many of you prefer speed over quality (not that there is too much loss in the conversion!)  As before, I will seed until the next basho.\n\n\nPS.
