Like the city he lives in and his beloved hometown NFL team, the down-an-out Vince (Mark Wahlberg, THE ITALIAN JOB) has seen better days.\n\nBut then the Philadelphia EaglesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ new coach Dick Vermeil (Greg Kinnear, LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE) calls an unprecedented open tryout, and the 30-year-old bartender who never played college ball makes the cut.\n\nNow Vince needs every bit of his gritty, never-say-die attitude and enormous heart to survive in the high-stakes world of professional football. Heartfelt and triumphant, and filled with body-slamming NFL football action, INVINCIBLE will have you on your feet cheering for the scrappy underdog who helped his team rediscover its winning spirits, and in the process rallied a city when it needed it most. \n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0445990/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0445990/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5f435b899475484bcf206276e710a98937825b9","amp;dn":"Invincible%5BGRAVITY-ZERO%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5f435b899475484bcf206276e710a98937825b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,244,53,184,153,71,84,132,188,242,6,39,110,113,10,152,147,120,37,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
