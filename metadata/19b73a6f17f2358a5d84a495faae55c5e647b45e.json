One, they cannot harm a human being or, through \ninaction, allow a human being to come to harm. Two, they must do whatever they're told by a human being as \nlong as such orders don't conflict with law one. Three, they have to defend themselves as long as such defense \ndoesn't conflict with laws one or two. One day, the writer of the three laws, Alfred Lanning, apparently \njumps out of the tenth-floor window of U.S. Robotics. The majority of the Chicago Police Department believe \nthat he committed suicide, but Detective Del Spooner, who hates robots, thinks he was murdered, and the \nnumber one suspect is a Nestor Class-5 robot who calls himself Sonny. However, if it was Sonny, then that \nmeans he would've had to have broken the three laws. With the help of Dr. Susan Calvin, Spooner must now \ndiscover the truth before it's too late.\n\n \nWill Smith ... Del Spooner\nBridget Moynahan ... Susan Calvin\nAlan Tudyk ...
