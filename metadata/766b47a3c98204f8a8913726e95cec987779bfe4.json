Two equally geeky friends of theirs, Howard and Rajesh, are also main characters. The show is produced by Warner Bros. Television and Chuck Lorre Productions.[3][4] The Big Bang Theory was recently picked up for a third and fourth season by CBS.[5] The Big Bang Theory will change timeslots for its third season and will now air at 9:30 EST following fellow-Chuck Lorre-produced Two and a Half Men.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory&lt;/a&gt;\n\n=======================\n\nSeason 1\n\nS01E01: Pilot\nS01E02: The Big Bran Hypothesis\nS01E03: The Fuzzy Boots Corollary\nS01E04: The Luminous Fish Effect\nS01E05: The Hamburger Postulate\nS01E06: The Middle Earth Paradigm\nS01E07: The Dumpling Paradox\nS01E08: The Grasshopper Experiment\nS01E09: The Cooper-Hofstadter Polarization\nS01E10: The Loobenfeld Decay\nS01E11: The Pancake Batter Anomaly\nS01E12: The Jerusalem Duality\nS01E13: The Bat Jar Conjecture\nS01E14: The Nerdvana Annihilation\nS01E15: The Pork Chop Indeterminacy\nS01E16: The Peanut Reaction\nS01E17: The Tangerine Factor\n\nSeason 2\n\nS02E01: The Bad Fish Paradigm\nS02E02: The Codpiece Topology\nS02E03: The Barbarian Sublimation\nS02E04: The Griffin Equivalency\nS02E05: The Euclid Alternative\nS02E06: The Cooper-Nowitzki Theorem\nS02E07: The Panty PiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ata Polarization\nS02E08: The Lizard-Spock Expansion\nS02E09: The White Asparagus Triangulation\nS02E10: The Vartabedian Conundrum\nS02E11: The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis\nS02E12: The Killer Robot Instability\nS02E13: The Friendship Algorithm\nS02E14: The Financial Permeability\nS02E15: The Maternal Capacitance\nS02E16: The Cushion Saturation\nS02E17: The Terminator Decoupling\nS02E18: The Work Song Nanocluster\nS02E19: The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition\nS02E20: The Hofstadter Isotope\nS02E21: The Vegas Renormalization\nS02E22: The Classified Materials Turbulence\nS02E23: The Monopolar Expedition\n\nSeason 3\n\nS03E01: The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation\nS03E02: The Jiminy Conjecture\nS03E03: The Gothowitz Deviation\nS03E04: The Pirate Solution\nS03E05: The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary\nS03E06: The Cornhusker Vortex\nS03E07: The Guitarist Amplification\nS03E08: The Adhesive Duck Deficiency\nS03E09: The Vengeance Formulation\nS03E10: The Gorilla Experiment\nS03E11: The Maternal Congruence\nS03E12: The Psychic Vortex\nS03E13: The Bozeman Reaction\nS03E14: The Einstein Approximation\nS03E15: The Einstein Approximation\nS03E16: The Excelsior Acquisition\nS03E17: The Precious Fragmentation\nS03E18: The Pants Alternative\nS03E19: The Wheaton Recurrence\nS03E20: The Spaghetti Catalyst\nS03E21: The Plimpton Stimulation\nS03E22: The Staircase Implementation\nS03E23: The Lunar Excitation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:766b47a3c98204f8a8913726e95cec987779bfe4","amp;dn":"The+Big+Bang+Theory+-+Seasons+1+through+3+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"766b47a3c98204f8a8913726e95cec987779bfe4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,107,71,163,201,130,4,248,168,145,55,38,233,92,236,152,119,121,191,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
