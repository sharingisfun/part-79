The kidnappers, completely off the map before Patty Hearst\ndisappeared into the San Francisco night, were a small band of young, \nferociously militant political radicals, dedicated to the rights of prisoners\nand the working class. They called themselves the Symbionese Liberation Army.\nOver the course of about three years they robbed banks, senselessly killed two\ninnocent people, instigated a firefight after attempting to shoplift a pair of\nsocks, and, most famously, converted their hostage and victim. They also \nachieved an undeniably visionary manipulation of the media, inciting perhaps\nthe first modern media frenzy. Presenting resonating questions about the role\nof the media in America--mouthpiece? Messenger? Truth seeker? --The ethical\ndilemmas posed by new technologies, and the proximity of madness to political\nextremism.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61f322a0e6af830cfe0bffc96e0ef21ba9076e5c","amp;dn":"Guerrilla.The.Taking.Of.Patty.Hearst.2004.SWESUB.DVBRip.XviD-Mov","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61f322a0e6af830cfe0bffc96e0ef21ba9076e5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,243,34,160,230,175,131,12,254,11,255,201,110,14,242,27,169,7,110,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
