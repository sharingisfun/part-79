Von Berkow\nPatricia Neal - Mrs. Bergson\nKay Lenz - Leah Bergson\nPaul Clemens - Paul Bergson\nChristopher Lee - Gypsy\n\t\nPlot Synopsis:\n\nLamentably simplistic and unpleasant World War II adventure story adapted by Bruce Nicolaysen from his own novel The Perilous Passage. Anthony Quinn trots out his usual Zorba act, whilst Malcolm McDowell camps it up with a comically histrionic performance as an SS sadist.\n\nA Basque shepherd (Anthony Quinn) is offered a large sum of money by the French resistance to ferry an escaping scientist (James Mason) and his family from Occupied France across the Pyrenees into Spain. All the time, the scientist is pursued by a tenacious SS officer Von Berkow (Malcolm McDowell).\n\nWidth x Height = 640 x 480\nAudio : 128kbps MP3\nVideo :\nFramerate-29fps\nData Rate-121kbps\nVideo Sampling Size-24 bit\nVideo Compression-XVID\nDuration:1:41:08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b1740f129e90e7349ac446712897d6c5787ead5","amp;dn":"The+Passage+1979","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b1740f129e90e7349ac446712897d6c5787ead5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,23,64,241,41,233,14,115,73,172,68,103,18,137,125,108,87,135,234,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
