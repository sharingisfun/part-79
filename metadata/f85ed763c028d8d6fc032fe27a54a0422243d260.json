The First Treatise is an extended attack on Sir Robert Filmer's Patriarcha, which argued for a divinely-ordained, hereditary, absolute monarchy. The more influential Second Treatise outlines a theory of civil society based on natural rights and contract theory. Locke begins by describing the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œstate of nature,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and goes on to explain the hypothetical rise of property and civilization, asserting that the only legitimate governments are those which have the consent of the people.\n\nLocke's ideas heavily influenced both the American and French Revolutions. His notions of people's rights and the role of civil government provided strong support for the intellectual movements of both revolutions. (Summary adapted from Wikipedia)\n\n\nLetter Concerning Toleration by John Locke was originally published in 1689. Its initial publication was in Latin, though it was immediately translated into other languages. In this ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œletterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ addressed to an anonymous ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHonored SirÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (actually Locke's close friend Philip von Limborch, who published it without Locke's knowledge) Locke argues for a new understanding of the relationship between religion and government. One of the founders of Empiricism, Locke develops a philosophy that is contrary to the one expressed by Thomas Hobbes in Leviathan, primarily because it supports toleration for various Christian denominations. Locke's work appeared amidst a fear that Catholicism might be taking over England, and responds to the problem of religion and government by proposing toleration as the answer.\n\nUnlike Hobbes, who saw uniformity of religion as the key to a well-functioning civil society, Locke argues that more religious groups actually prevent civil unrest. Locke argues that civil unrest results from confrontations caused by any magistrate's attempt to prevent different religions from being practiced, rather than tolerating their proliferation. Locke's primary goal is to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdistinguish exactly the business of civil government from that of religion.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ He makes use of extensive argument from analogy to accomplish his goal, and relies on several key points. The thing that he wants to persuade the reader of is that government is instituted to promote external interests, relating to life, liberty, and the general welfare, while the church exists to promote internal interests, i.e., salvation. The two serve separate functions, and so, must be considered to be separate institutions.\n\n(Summary from Wikipedia)\n\n\n\nAn M4B file is an audio file which can be bookmarked. This is the audio-book file type. These files can have chapter markers which can be skipped through as you would skip through files on a play list. They can have built in cover art and chapter images. They will remember where you left off each time you stop the file and come back to it . And variable speed settings on Ipods and a growing number of other mp3 players can be utilized by this file type. The ability to bookmark allows for as little as one large file instead of many small ones without the burden of fast forwarding to find your spot every time you resume listening or the fear of otherwise losing your place. The reduced number of files also makes browsing through your files to find your book and your place in it much less effort.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f85ed763c028d8d6fc032fe27a54a0422243d260","amp;dn":"Librivox+M4B+Audiobook+-+Two+Treatises+of+Civil+Government+%26+A+L","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f85ed763c028d8d6fc032fe27a54a0422243d260","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,94,215,99,192,40,216,214,252,3,47,226,122,84,160,66,34,67,210,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
