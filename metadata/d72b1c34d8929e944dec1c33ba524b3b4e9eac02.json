There are four playable races, each with its advantages and weakness. The player will control a leader whose class and specialization must be chosen in the beginning of the game. The leader could be either warrior or mage. When warrior, he can equip many weapons and armor. If the leader is a mage he should furthermore choose one of the two available for the race schools of magic. The other becomes unavailable for him to learn, although he still could use its spells if they are written on scrolls. The mage can handle only certain weapons and cannot equip armor or shield. His protective wears are mage robes and mantles.\n\nFeatures:\nFull 3d engine based on DirectX 9.0 features;\nBoth strategic and third person view;\nFour unique races with own architecture;\nAbility to create and develop a Leader - unique for every race;\nMore than 100 unique units;\nOver 80 special effects and spells;\nBillions of items with various characteristics and usefulness.
