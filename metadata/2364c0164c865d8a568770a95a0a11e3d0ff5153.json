For instance 5/5 in Slavestate Magazine (Sweden), 9/10 in Extreem Music (Spain), 8,5/10 in Imhotep Magazine (Norway) and statements such as &quot;All in all a very solid and convincing longplayer which should appeal to all high quality Death Metal heads out there. This one is again Danish dynamite!&quot; (Voices From The Darkside - Germany) and &quot;Usipian is heavy as only death metal can be. Satan should be proud!&quot; (Metallian - Canada).\n\nThrough the years Usipian has played many live shows with bands such as Vader, Macabre, Aura Noir, Exmortem, Godhate (ex-Throneaeon) and Iniquity.\n\n\nLast known line-up \nToke Eld - Vocals (The Cleansing)\nAndreas Lynge - Guitar (In a Void, The Cleansing, Corpus Mortale)\nJeppe Hasseriis - Guitar (Azalon, Dunkel (Dnk), Strychnos, The Cleansing)\nKent VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦rens - Bass (Ad Noctum (Dnk))\nNis Rode Larsen - Drums (Strychnos) \n\nReview\nWritten by ouroboricmutusliber on April 26th, 2009 \n\nFirst and foremost, considering this title was produced by Flemming Rasmussen, the man behind a slew of &quot;slightly&quot; over-produced albums, it is worth saying that this album's production is not of the 2009 digital-age space-bar kick drum variety. It has a certain grain to it that is just perfect for a death metal band - Incantation with a bit more expense on production - I suppose that goes without saying when you've got the guy behind Metallica behind YOU.\n\nThe opener &quot;In Skinless Form&quot; is one of those tracks that you'll find yourself rewinding back and back to your favorite riffs. (01:39) It has a groovy feel not too uncommon these days with death metal acts - but it's something fresh nonetheless - hell, the whole album is. \n\nThe album goes through a few motions that do not go easily unnoticed. The second track &quot;Flag Of Our Fathers&quot; seemingly has but a few lyrics (take a guess!), but it's absolutely addictive. The one downside of this track being that you notice the played-out &quot;inhale/exhale&quot; vocals of the 21st century occurring. Toke's vocals are generally more interesting than this. (I'm not very familiar with prior releases though - so who knows).\n\n&quot;Second To Nothing&quot; - the only other track from this studio session - begins with a deceitful melodic riff quickly torn apart by one last final death metal ballad. The drums really shine on this track; sticking out AND blending amidst the grandeur. (04:29) The albums only solo begins to kick in and it is interesting how uninspired it really is - the song as a whole is mid-tempo and fits more seamlessly into the album itself than as a stand-alone track. \n\nThe final two tracks are from the &quot;Clouded Restrainment&quot; EP and I will hold off on any opinions on it other than that sonically you can't tell the difference between the two recording sessions. Right on!\n\nGenre = Brutal Death Metal\nFormat = Mp3\nBit Rate = Vbr\n\nTrack Listing\n01. In skinless form \n02. Flag of our fathers \n03. Second to nothing \n04. Clouded restrainment \n05.
