Free of the apocalyptic battles and black-leather-clad demagogues that would soon come to dominate this genre, this pic starts with, and stays with, the commonplace, such as mining mountains of refuse for usable canned goods. From comic books, Glen has an image of a shining city somewhere &quot;out there.&quot; He and the by-now pregnant Randa (they're teenagers) set out on a journey to find it. Along the way, they find a horse, a house, a companion, an ocean where there ought not to be one, and a boat. No pillars of fire. No Statue of Liberty toppled on the beach. This is a small movie that views the small subject of day-to-day survival from a strictly human viewpoint.\n\n\n IMDb.............: User Rating of 2.0/10\n\n Year.............: 1970\n Country..........: U.S.A.\n Runtime..........: 93 Minutes\n Audio............: LANGUAGE(S)English 2.0 (Dolby Digital)\n Subtitles........: LANGUAGE(S) None\n Video Format.....: NTSC \n Aspect Ratio.....: 1.85/1\n DVD Format.......: Anamorphic \n DVD Source.......: DVD9\n DVD Distributor..: VCI\n Program..........: DVDfab Decrypter \n Average Bit Rate.: ?.??
