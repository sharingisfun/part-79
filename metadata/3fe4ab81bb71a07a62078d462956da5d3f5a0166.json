The boys went to \nbreak and never came back, plus I left the live read in\nat the end as there was still a show going on sort of. \n\nNote: I plan on having the shows up a smidge earlier \ntomorrow, I figured out some tricks to speed things up\na bit. I'm also doing some infrastructure upgrades in \nthe next few weeks which should also lead to earlier \nups. That's the good news. The bad news is I'm planning \non &quot;retiring&quot; from posting O&amp;A (it's simply a logistics\nthing) in December of this year. That's plenty of notice\nto find another reliable daily uploader of O&amp;A. \n\n\n\nFor more O&amp;A try shuazien's classic episodes:    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/shuazien/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/shuazien/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDrDumb continues The Virus with Ron and Fez:    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/drdumb/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/drdumb/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPiratebay sale may happen at the end of the month!\nGet your O&amp;A here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://isohunt.com/release?poster=mothergoose56&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://isohunt.com/release?poster=mothergoose56&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBOOKMARK THIS IMMEDIATELY so you can get O&amp;A if/when tpb is gone.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fe4ab81bb71a07a62078d462956da5d3f5a0166","amp;dn":"Opie+and+Anthony+2009-09-03-O%26A+CF128k+VBR+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fe4ab81bb71a07a62078d462956da5d3f5a0166","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,228,171,129,187,113,160,122,98,7,141,70,41,86,218,93,63,90,1,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
