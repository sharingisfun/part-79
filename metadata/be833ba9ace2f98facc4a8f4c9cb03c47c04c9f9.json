Twenty years later, the initial welcome by the human population has faded. The refugee camp where the aliens were located has deteriorated into a militarized ghetto called District 9, where they are confined and exploited in squalor. In 2010, the munitions corporation, Multi-National United, is contracted to forcibly evict the population with operative Wikus van der Merwe in charge. In this operation, Wikus is exposed to a strange alien chemical and must rely on the help of his only two new 'Prawn' friends.\nCast\n  (Cast overview, first billed only)\n\tSharlto Copley\t... \tWikus Van De Merwe\n\tJason Cope\t... \tGrey Bradnam - UKNR Chief Correspondent\n\n\tNathalie Boltt\t... \tSarah Livingstone - Sociologist\n\tSylvaine Strike\t... \tDr Katrina McKenzie\n\tElizabeth Mkandawie\t... \tInterviewee\n\n\tJohn Sumner\t... \tLes Feldman - MIL Engineer\n\n\tWilliam Allen Young\t... \tDirk Michaels\n\tGreg Melvill-Smith\t... \tInterviewer\n\n\tNick Blake\t... \tFrancois Moraneu - CIV Engineer Team\n\tMorena Busa Sesatsa\t... \tInterviewee\n\tThemba Nkosi\t... \tInterviewee\n\tMzwandile Nqoba\t... \tInterviewee\n\tBarry Strydom\t... \tInterviewee\n\n\tJed Brophy\t... \tJames Hope - Police Officer\n\tLouis Minnaar\t... \tPiet Smit\nAudio Russian (6 chn)\nSubs Russian\nMenu-yes\nChapters-yes\nAlso i have included posters and covers etc\nFile size is 4.45GB inc Artwork\n[url]http://www.fhqhosting.com/ui/1ggggg.swf[/url]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be833ba9ace2f98facc4a8f4c9cb03c47c04c9f9","amp;dn":"District+9_DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be833ba9ace2f98facc4a8f4c9cb03c47c04c9f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,131,59,169,172,226,249,143,172,196,168,244,201,203,3,196,124,4,201,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
