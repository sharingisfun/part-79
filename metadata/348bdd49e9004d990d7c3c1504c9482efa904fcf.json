Formed in 2006, their defiant anthems have already earned them an anti-gravity cult status. Geared with a toothpaste fresh sound and a dangerous stage presence, it would be wrong to call The Supersonics a band. They are a milk-drinking, vitamin-popping call to arms. They are a shiny new revolution. \n\nGarage/Indie/Punk/Alternative/BlahÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦their sound is not pigeonholed to any one genre. The band has a huge, loyal and steadily increasing fan base. They write songs that are addictive like chocolate. One of the very few bands that has the crowd singing along with them on practically every one of their original songs. Their live sets are high voltage. \n\nMABY BAKING is on its way from the studio. The album was recorded under the watchful eye of producer Miti Adhikari, veteran sound engineer with the BBC in London, who has worked with the likes of Nirvana, Radiohead, and The White Stripes. The album is in his hands in its mastering stages and will see daylight anytime now. Its been a long, hard wait but its now a reality. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thesupersonics.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thesupersonics.net&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:348bdd49e9004d990d7c3c1504c9482efa904fcf","amp;dn":"%5BIndie+from+India%5D+The+Supersonics+-+Maby+Baking+%5B2009%5D+%5Bthunder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"348bdd49e9004d990d7c3c1504c9482efa904fcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,139,221,73,233,0,77,153,13,124,60,21,4,201,72,46,250,144,79,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
