Shrek suddenly finds himself in a twisted, alternate version of Far Far Away, where ogres are hunted, Rumpelstiltskin is king, and Shrek and Fiona have never met. Now, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to Shrek to undo all heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s done in the hopes of saving his friends, restoring his world, and reclaiming his one True Love.\n\nThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tons of living room fun to be had in the Shrek Forever After video game, which turns Shrek into a social and team experience that the whole family can enjoy. Players can join in on the action at any time in the co-operative multiplayer mode to form a team of up to four players. Together, teams can navigate through ShrekÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s two realities while solving mind-bending puzzles, and fending off RumplestiltskinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s army of baddies. Shrek, Fiona, Puss In Boots, and Donkey, all have their own unique game skills that will come in handy to progress through the game. A single-player experience is also offered, which allows the player to switch between the four characters as needed at any time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75bab3f57146a446f2699c7e1117a28b34b75fbe","amp;dn":"Shrek+Forever+After+%5BPC-DVD%5D%5BMulti6%5D%5BSpanish%5D%5Bwww.consolasatope.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75bab3f57146a446f2699c7e1117a28b34b75fbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,186,179,245,113,70,164,70,242,105,156,126,17,23,162,139,52,183,95,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
