It is the third 3D game in the Grand Theft Auto video game franchise, the fifth original console release and eighth game overall. Originally released for the PlayStation 2 in October 2004,[2] the game has since been ported to the Xbox and Microsoft Windows, and has received wide acclaim and high sales figures on all three platforms, and is the highest selling game of all time on PlayStation 2 so far. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was succeeded by Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories and was preceded by Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.\n\nThe game is set in the fictional state of San Andreas, comprising three metropolitan cities. Set in March 1992,[9] San Andreas revolves around the gang member Carl &quot;CJ&quot; Johnson returning home from Liberty City to Los Santos after learning of his mother's murder. CJ finds his old friends and family in disarray. Over the course of the game, CJ gradually unravels the plot behind his mother's murder while exploring his own business ventures. Like other games in the series, San Andreas is composed of elements from driving games and third-person shooters, and features &quot;open-world&quot; gameplay that gives the player more control over their playing experience. The game adds several features, such as car customization, and character personalization.\n\nSystem requirements\n\nMicrosoft Windows\n\n1 GHz Intel Pentium III or AMD Athlon CPU \n256 MB RAM \n8x DVD drive \n3.6 GB hard disk space \n64 MB DirectX 9.0-compatible graphics card \nDirectX 9.0-compatible sound card \nWindows 2000/XP.\n\nInput methods\n\nKeyboard and mouse, Gamepad \n\nthis is the real deal folks follow instructions in txt file in crack directory in iso file for crackikng instructions\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba117a4b81b41f94c45236a3d62724ddcb9bafb5","amp;dn":"Grand+Theft+Auto%3A+San+Andreas+%2B+crack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba117a4b81b41f94c45236a3d62724ddcb9bafb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,17,122,75,129,180,31,148,196,82,54,163,214,39,36,221,203,155,175,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
