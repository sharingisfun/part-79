Here, far from the barbarian despoliation of the continent, monks and scribes laboriously, lovingly, even playfully preserved the WestÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s written treasury. When stability returned in Europe, these Irish scholars were instrumental in spreading learning, becoming not only the conservators of civilization, but also the shapers of the medieval mind, putting their unique stamp on Western culture. Many great pieces of Greek and Roman literature, almost sure to be lost in the chaos of the Middle Ages, were saved by the monks of Ireland. This brilliant audio edition of the bestselling book is read by acclaimed actor Liam Neeson.\nRead by Donal Donnelly\nAudio: CD rip to MP3, 2ch, 32kbps\n\n-----------------------------------------\nVisit us for this and loads more at:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.com\n-----------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:910e1d8e6d73f196cef3b1029428687b2959e2a7","amp;dn":"How+the+Irish+Saved+Civilization+-+Thomas+Cahill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"910e1d8e6d73f196cef3b1029428687b2959e2a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,14,29,142,109,115,241,150,206,243,177,2,148,40,104,123,41,89,226,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
