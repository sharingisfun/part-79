Control six gun positions in the famous B-17 bomber to fend off attacks by enemy fighters. The game includes 25 missions and 5 types of realistic Luftwaffe enemy aircraft. \n\nMy warning: \nI played this game and I think, that its unvaried, monotonous game! Really good idea for game players, but effect is poor. And games with B-17 theme are only few.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6b1ca982ff175fd5acee548f72502cf25e58850","amp;dn":"B-17+Gunner+Air+War+Over+Germany+-replaced-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6b1ca982ff175fd5acee548f72502cf25e58850","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,177,202,152,47,241,117,253,90,206,229,72,247,37,2,207,37,229,136,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
