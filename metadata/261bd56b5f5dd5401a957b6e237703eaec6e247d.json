There are hints that the filmmakers had seen &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, but &quot;The Iron Crown&quot; also anticipates films as disparate as &quot;Shrek&quot;, &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;, and many of the renewed pepla cycle of the 60s. The film is also echoed by Cocteau's &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, though it is certainly a lighter hearted affair.\n\nWrestler Primo Carnera is on hand as a loyal strong man, adding interest for fans of the squared circle. Skillfully blending comedy, romance, and action, this is not to be missed. \n\n*.*.*\n\nLa corona di ferro (American title: The Iron Crown) is a 1941 Italian award winning fantasy film written and directed by Alessandro Blasetti.\n\nThe Goebbels Experiment documentary film tells that Josef Goebbels disliked the film when he saw it at Venice Film Festival (his comment was that, had a German director made this film, that director would have been shot). The film won a Coppa Mussolini, ancestor award to the Golden Lion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:261bd56b5f5dd5401a957b6e237703eaec6e247d","amp;dn":"La+Corona+Di+Ferro+-+Alessandro+Blasetti+-+1941.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"261bd56b5f5dd5401a957b6e237703eaec6e247d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,27,213,107,95,93,213,64,26,149,123,110,35,119,3,234,236,110,36,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
