After Dallas kicker Nick Folk watched his 24-yard field goal try clang off the right upright shortly before the 2-minute warning, Brees got a final chance to tie it.\n\nBrees quickly moved the Saints into Dallas territory. But on second down, Ware sacked Brees and forced a fumble that was recovered by the Cowboys with 6 seconds left.\n\nRomo passed for 312 yards, including a 49-yard touchdown to Miles Austin.\n\nWare returned from a neck injury that left his status in doubt and was part of a relentless Dallas pass rush that pressured Brees all night.\n\nMarion Barber had two touchdown runs for the Cowboys (9-5), who ended a two-game skid and proved they were good enough to beat the top team in the NFC in front of a charged-up, hostile crowd.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c243180feb568dc973a0a0ed7ea5c28b3440e3d4","amp;dn":"2009+Week+15+Cowboys+Saints","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c243180feb568dc973a0a0ed7ea5c28b3440e3d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,67,24,15,235,86,141,201,115,160,160,237,126,165,194,139,52,64,227,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
