Is My Lady is a 1984 (see 1984 in music) album by Frank Sinatra, featuring arrangements by Quincy Jones. It was the last solo album that Sinatra recorded. Though it is the last solo album released, it isn't the last solo songs he released as in the last three songs on The Complete Reprise Studio Recordings disc 20.\n\nThe album came after an album of duets between Sinatra and Lena Horne, instigated by Jones, was abandoned after Horne developed vocal problems and Sinatra, committed to other engagements, couldn't wait to record. This was the first studio album Sinatra had recorded with Jones since 1964's It Might as Well Be Swing.\n\nThe sessions were filmed, with a small audience, and released as Frank Sinatra: Portrait of an Album (1985). The documentary shows Sinatra meeting Michael Jackson for the first time, with Jones affectionately calling Jackson &quot;Smelly&quot;.\n\nEddie Van Halen, Donna Summer and David Lee Roth make cameo appearances in the video for L.A. Is My Lady, which in turn made moderate rotation on the fledgling MTV Network.\n\nDespite its title, the album was recorded in New York City. The album peaked at #58 on the Billboard 200, and #8 on the Top Jazz Albums chart.\n\n        1.\tL. A.
