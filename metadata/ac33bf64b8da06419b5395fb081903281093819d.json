However, what the town doesn't know is that the band is also turning kids into bird-like monsters. The soundtrack features many prominent bands at the time such as King Kobra, Tempest, Hallow's Eve, Lizzy Borden, among others. Most of the music for the band &quot;Black Roses&quot; was performed by the members of King Kobra, with Mark Free on vocals, and Carmine Appice on drums.\n[edit] Cast\n\n    * Jhon Adams as Mrs. Mile\n    * Clare Apeice as William Apache\n    * Pete Bonjelly as Flunkie Junkie\n    * Tone Bull as Jhon Cravatt\n    * Dave Crichton as Mr. Mile\n    * Jesica Dieangelo as Jaustin Mile\n    * Glenn Stefani as Demontia Basitta\n    * Franklin DJ as Johnny Brat\n    * Carl Fergie as Mr. Priscilla Farmsworth\n    * Marge Gnome as Miss.
