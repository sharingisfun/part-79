Their sacrifice succeeded in subduing an empire and making freedom of religion and thought possible. But, their success was short-lived.\n\nThrough the centuries since the Reformation, we have lost the beliefs the reformers stood for. We have allowed God's truth to be mixed with error. Today, we reap the repercussions of our lethargic neglect. The Roman Empire's wound is healed, and politicians and heads of state follow papal Rome without reluctance.\n\nProfessor Veith presents clear insight into the underlying objectives of today's political, economic, and religious manoeuvrings. He explains why we may have to fight the battle of the Reformation all over again.\n\nWill you know the issues and understand the enemies' tactics enough to resist error? This series will equip you.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://amazingdiscoveries.org/webstore/us/history-general/history-dvds/rekindling-the-reformation-series/rekindling-the-reformation.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://amazingdiscoveries.org/webstore/us/history-general/history-dvds/rekindling-the-reformation-series/rekindling-the-reformation.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n  ____                      _                      _   _       _\n / ___|___  _ __  ___ _ __ (_)_ __ __ _  ___ _   _| | | |_   _| |__\n| |   / _ \\| '_ \\/ __| '_ \\| | '__/ _` |/ __| | | | |_| | | | | '_ \\\n| |__| (_) | | | \\__ \\ |_) | | | | (_| | (__| |_| |  _  | |_| | |_) |\n \\____\\___/|_| |_|___/ .__/|_|_|  \\__,_|\\___|\\__, |_| |_|\\__,_|_.__/\n                     |_|                     |___/\n   ____\n  / ___|___  _ __ ___\n | |   / _ \\| '_ ` _ \\\n | |__| (_) | | | | | |\n(_)____\\___/|_| |_| |_|\n\n\nPLEASE KEEP SEEDED TO PASS ON THE MESSAGE.
