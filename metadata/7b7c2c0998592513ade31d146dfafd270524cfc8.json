MTV News Writer Kyle Anderson called the album &quot;a tremendous collection of hard rock songs that center around the axe man's signature chunky, swirling riffs.... On balance, it's an excellent album, and it feels good to have that classic Slash sound back.&quot; Writer Shelby Powell took note of Slash's precision on guitar, rating the album 3.5/5 thumbs, but took off points for &quot;a little too much reverence paid to the 90ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s and some of the feature selections may have old head purists poking their bottom lips out and putting their lighters down,&quot; but concludes that &quot;the assortment of genres blends well.&quot;\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b7c2c0998592513ade31d146dfafd270524cfc8","amp;dn":"Slash+feat.+Andrew+Stockdale-By+The+Sword+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b7c2c0998592513ade31d146dfafd270524cfc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,124,44,9,152,89,37,19,173,227,29,20,109,250,253,39,5,36,207,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
