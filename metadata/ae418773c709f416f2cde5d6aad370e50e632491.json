Install Left 4 Dead 2:\n\n* Extract the files from &lt;l4d2_clean_2.0.0.0&gt; Dir. using 7zip (winrar was reported to record errors). I recomend this and no other installer since the clean 2.0 was the only one working for me (tested several clients and all failed)\n\nII. Update Left 4 Dead 2:\n\n* Update L4D2 to the latest version using the update installers:\n  1. Install &lt;L4D2_Full_Update_2013_The_Passing&gt; //The Update will update the client to v2.0.1.3\n  2.

Patch Game with Rev-Emu:\n\n* Install Latest Rev-Emu Installer which includes left4dead2.exe and Setti masterserver.vdf.(MEANING &lt;L4D2_RevEmu_for_v2014&gt; ). Install to your Left 4 Dead 2 Installation Folder and choose which fix to use (either RevEmu or RevExe).\n* Edit rev.ini with notepad to change your name. (SteamUser=YourName and PlayerName=YourName)\n* Edit rev.ini depending on how you would like to play:\n\t- For playing single player via the main menu:\n\tEdit rev.ini with notepad and comment out the ClientDLL line with a # like this:\n\t#ClientDLL=steamclient_l4d2.dll\n\t- For playing online and enable serverbrowser and SteamGroupServer on main menu:\n\tEdit rev.ini with notepad and confirm the ClientDLL line is not commented out:\n\tClientDLL=steamclient_l4d2.dll\n\t\nGo into your Left 4 Deadbinconfig folder and make sure Masterserver.vdf is set to Read-Only. The latest RevEmu installer will set this to read-only for you.\n\n* Use openserverbrowser in console to open the server browser.\nSetti servers will now show up in the custom tab of the server browser.\nFavorites tab doesn't work - Don't use it - it will crash your game\nSETTI Steam Group Servers will be available via the Main Menu for quick connection to servers!!\n\nV. Play by executing Left4Dead2.exe:\n\n* The latest Rev-Emu installer will create a desktop icon for you.\n\n\nNOTE:\n\tIf you previously used Stryder Loader and wish to move to the New Rev-Emu:\n\t1-Remove Stryder Loader: delete stryder.dll, stryder.ini, stryder.txt, IniGen.exe from root \tfolder and remove Name Enabler Addon.\n\t2-Install repacked update with new patched client.dll.\n\t3-Install latest rev-emu.\n\nFor further details &amp; help read: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://blog.theevilpc.com/2009/11/how-to-update-and-play-left-4-dead-2-no.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://blog.theevilpc.com/2009/11/how-to-update-and-play-left-4-dead-2-no.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nEnjoy the game!\n\nPS:\nIf you fallowed all this steps, exactly as i described them and the game doesn't work, you've donne something wrong.
