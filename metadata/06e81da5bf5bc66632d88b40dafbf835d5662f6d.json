Carrie Fisher, William Shatner, and Ray Park turn up for cameos in the one comedy that truly understands the fanboy mindset.\n\n\n\n                                Mpaa Rating++++++++++\n\n           Rated PG-13 for pervasive crude and sexual material, language and drug content. \n\n\n                                Retail Release Date++++++++\n\n                                   13 February 2009\n\n\n                                DVD Content++++++++++\n\n                             \n                 Main Movie+++++++++++++++\n\t              +Video- CCE Encoded - 5 passes\n\t              +Audio-English \t\n\t              +Subs-Spanish\n\n                 Menu+++++++\n\t              +Yes\t\n              \n                 Extras/Special Features+++++\n\t              +Yes\n\n                 Removed++++++++++++++\n\t              FBI crap and trailers and all of the other annoying and useless stuff.\n\n\n\n                 Chapters++++++++++++++\n\n1.
