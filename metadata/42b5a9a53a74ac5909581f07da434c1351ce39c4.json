The album was released in 1982 and was a turning point for the band as they gained critical and commercial success in the UK and Europe. It made #3 in the UK Albums Chart.\n\nThe record generated a handful of singles; &quot;Promised You a Miracle&quot; (released in April 1982), &quot;Glittering Prize&quot; (August 1982) and &quot;Someone Somewhere (In Summertime)&quot; (November 1982). The title track saw a limited release in Italy, when the band visited the country during their tour in March 1983. In addition, the jazz keyboardist Herbie Hancock performed a synthesizer solo on the track &quot;Hunter and the Hunted.&quot;\n\nVirgin Records reissued the album as a remastered edition in 2002 (cardboard vinyl replica edition) and early 2003 (jewel-case). On the 2002/2003 edition, the gaps between the tracks on the album are slightly shorter.
