It objectively and methodically documents the hidden alliance between new versions and the New Age Movement's One World Religion. \n\nThe Message \nThe emerging 'new' Christianity - with its substitution of riches for righteousness, a crown for a cross, and an imitation for a new creation - is shown to be a direct result of the wording in new versions. Documented are the thousands of words, verses, and doctrines by which new versions will prepare the apostate churches of these last days to accept the religion of the Antichrist - even his mark, image, and Lucifer worship.\n\nThe Men \nExposing new version editors - in agreement with Luciferians, occultists and New Age philosophy.\n\nThe Manuscripts \nThe Greek manuscripts, critical editions, lexicons and dictionaries behind the new versions are examined, revealing their occult origins, contents, and yet unreleased material - a blueprint for the Antichrist's One World Religion and government. Also presented is the latest research proving that the Authorized King James Version represents not only Christianity's earliest and most widely used Greek text, but is the easiest version to read according to computer analysis based formulas from the Flesch-Kincaid research firm.\n\n************************************************************************************\n\nLanguage: English / Video Format: FLV\n\n************************************************************************************\n\nVisit us at:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dreamingofheaven.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dreamingofheaven.com&lt;/a&gt;\n(To access our torrents click the &quot;Login&quot; link)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb9ef2e411677d86fa06bf4bc63205f547f5bfa0","amp;dn":"New+Age+Bible+Versions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb9ef2e411677d86fa06bf4bc63205f547f5bfa0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,158,242,228,17,103,125,134,250,6,191,75,198,50,5,245,71,245,191,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
