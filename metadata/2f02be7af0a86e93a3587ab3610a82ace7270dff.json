Son And Daughter\n11. Liar\n12. In The Lap Of The Gods\n\nThis is not the complete concert. It is the pre-fm source (Westwood One) I have. It`s an upgrade to earlier \n\nversions. It exists a bootleg called &quot;A Night Up The Chimney&quot; with following setlist:\n\n01. Now I'm Here\n02. Ogre Battle\n03. White Queen (As It Began)\n04. Queen Medley:\n   Bohemian Rhapsody\n   Killer Queen\n   March Of The Black Queen\n   Bohemian Rhapsody reprise\n05. Bring Back That Leroy Brown\n06. Brighton Rock / Son And Daughter reprise\n07. Keep Yourself Alive\n08. Liar\n09.

Seven Seas Of Rhye\n12. ** See What A Fool I've Been\n13. *** God Save The Queen\n\nThis seems to be the complete concert. But it`s fm sourced and the quality is inferior. Also tracks 10 up to \n\n13 are lossy, because these tracks were never broadcasted.\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f02be7af0a86e93a3587ab3610a82ace7270dff","amp;dn":"Queen-Hammersmith+Odeon+24%2F12%2F75+%28FLAC%29+%5Btntvillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f02be7af0a86e93a3587ab3610a82ace7270dff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,2,190,122,240,168,110,147,163,88,122,179,97,10,130,172,231,39,13,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
