Just download all three and dump them together to get the full torrent.\n\n\n1970s Musical Hits Torrent ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ SHORT VERSION:\n\nThis torrent contains almost all of the major pop / rock hits of the 1980s. They are mostly in 128 kbps mp3 format. If a song was popular during the decade, it is probably in this collection. It is offered AS IS. Read the details below before you ask questions.\n\n\n1980s Musical Hits Torrent ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ DETAILED NOTES:\n\nLike many other people, I have a collection of music on my computer divided up by my own little system. While some bands or genres get their own folder (Billy Joel, Punk, Opera, etc.), I mostly have it chopped up into hits by decade. The only test to make it in is if I like the song, not whether it was some loser extra track on an album, or some admittedly large hit that I personally didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t like. Every now and then, I would hear some tune I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have, download it, and add it to the file.\n\nThe problem is that some of these songs are damned hard to find, especially since the essential break-up of single file p2p sharing in favor of huge full album or discography collections. Those are great for groups like the Rolling Stones ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ especially if you are an anal-retentive audiophile screaming for everything at high bit rates or .flac ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but what if you heard ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“the LoverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ConcertoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ by the Toys on the dinerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s background music last night, and just want a copy of that? The torrenting world can make it hard to find.\n\nThis collection contains most of the major hits and memorable songs of the 1970s from the world of pop and rock. There is a little country cross-over, but not much. If you listen to your local 80s station, this torrent is probably most of their playlist, give or take a few tunes. What I have done is taken my own 10-year-old and steadily added to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“1980sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ file, and deliberately added the billboard top 100 songs from each year. Each year IS available by other uploaders individually, but I have found most of them to be poorly seeded, often mis-tagged, and named rather stupidly. Let me explain what *I* have done, and why:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tNamed each file by ARTIST ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ TITLE (I have removed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“THEÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ from the names of any artist to ease searchability, and have kept to the convention of first names. For example; Diana Ross rather than Ross, Diana, and simply Beatles rather than THE Beatles or Beatles, the. That crap is just bloody annoying.)\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tSince the autotaggers tend to find tunes by compilation, I have renamed the albums and genre simply to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Hits From 198XÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“1980s HitsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. There may be the odd error here and there, but these should be mostly reliable.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tThe track numbers are essentially meaningless in this kind of compilation, so I sorted them by year and then alphabetically.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tKept the bit rate to 128-160 kbps .mp3 for the sake of space. Most of the files were burned that way in the first place.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tIn the case of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“superbandsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ groups that had TONS of hits in the decade, I have largely left them out simply because I keep that music in individual folders, and the complete discographies for these are already well seeded all over the place.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tCleaned up the tags to remove all comments and crap, leaving only a link to a music website article, and an innocuous 1970s graphic. All extraneous garbage about labels, composers and such is deliberately eliminated.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tLeft the files loose (no .rar or .zip files) so that people could snag that song whose absence from their collection is making them crazy. The collection is entirely of either official top 100 hits, and/or songs I personally remember and like. Some deeply rare or esoteric tune from your dadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s shitty New Orleans garage band in 1981 is not going to be here. I meant this torrent to be one-stop shopping for popular 1980s pop/rock. No more, no less. I know that I have to be missing some songs IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll add after I post this, but this torrent is still a fairly complete starting point for a 1970s collection. It took me ten years to gather all this ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ not a bad download at one hit for YOU.\n\n\nI want to be clear on a couple things. This collection is NOT an offering of complete albums or discographies. Those are already available all over the place. I also donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have most of these albums, so no, I CANNOT make this or that song available in a different format or at a higher bit rate. This entire torrent is a meta-collection of other peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work; tweaked, renamed, and reorganized. I often have trouble finding what *I* am looking for, so I assume other people have the same problem. This is simply a collection of hit songs offered in a very generic format and bit rate. If you are looking for the entire album of some 1982 one-hit wonder offered in 320 kbps, it isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t here and I cannot help you. In all likelihood, that album has never been released on DVD anyway ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ most of these are from compilation collections. This is also the entirety of what I have at the present time. If you are searching for some song that isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t here, keep looking ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have it. I hope you enjoy it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:013e05c6d9655ca9fc99546657625987b1b769fe","amp;dn":"1980s+Pop+%26+Rock+Hits+-+Damn+Near+ALL+of+Them+-+1+of+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"013e05c6d9655ca9fc99546657625987b1b769fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,62,5,198,217,101,92,169,252,153,84,102,87,98,89,135,177,183,105,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
