But it will use existing GH3(U) save data if there is any.\n\nThis one is a collection of Kamelot and Bullet for My Valentine.  Most of career mode is the former, with the last tier and the bonus being the latter.\n\nPLEASE MAKE NOTE- I take no credit whatsoever for arranging the note charts. The lovely people at the FoF forums did all the heavy lifting. All I did was put their work into a Wii game.\n\nAlso, there are a few other things done.  For one, GH3 was made 2 years ago and to account for inflation, the point values have been increased.  And since the song I put for the final battle was not as long as the original battle, it was impossible to beat Lou, so I changed his boss multipliers to equal Slash.  But he is still pretty damn tough considering the chart you play him with.  \n\nThanks to the FoF forum and teamGhost for making this possible.\n\nKamelot\n--------\nKamelot - Millennium (1998)\nKamelot - Siege (1998)\nKamelot - Until Kingdom Come (2000)\nKamelot - The Shadow Of Uther (2000)\nKamelot - Lunar Sanctum (2000)\n\n\n\nKamelot - Silent Goddess (2000)\nKamelot - The Inquisitor (2000)\nKamelot - The Fourth Legacy (2000)\nKamelot - Elizabeth III: Fall From Grace (2001)\nKamelot - Forever (2001)\nKamelot - Across The Highlands (2001)\n\n\n\nKamelot - The Spell (2001)\nKamelot - Wings Of Despair (2001)\nKamelot - Karma (2001)\nKamelot - Like the Shadows (2003)\nKamelot - Farewell (2003)\n\n\n\nKamelot - Lost And Damned (2003)\nKamelot - The Edge Of Paradise (2003)\nKamelot - Descent Of The Archangel (2003)\nKamelot - Center Of The Universe (2003)\nKamelot - III Ways To Epica (2003)\n\n\n\nKamelot - Serenade (2005)\nKamelot - Soul Society (2005)\nKamelot - March Of Mephisto (2005)\nKamelot - When The Lights Are Down (2005)\nKamelot - This Pain (2005)\nKamelot - Nothing Ever Dies (2005)\n\n\n\nKamelot - Memento Mori (2005)\nKamelot - The Black Halo\nKamelot - Rule The World (2007)\nKamelot - Eden Echo (2007)\nKamelot - The Human Stain (2007)\n\n\n\nKamelot - Mourning Star (2007)\nKamelot - Up Through The Ashes (2007)\nKamelot - Silence Of The Darkness (2007)\nKamelot - BlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼cher (2007)\nKamelot - Ghost Opera (2007)\n\n Bullet for my Valentine\n------------------------\nBullet For My Valentine - Hand Of Blood (2005)\nBullet For My Valentine - Curses (2005)\nBullet For My Valentine - No Control (2005)\nBullet For My Valentine - Just Another Star (2006)\nBullet For My Valentine - Turn To Despair (2006)\n\nBonus songs\n-----------\nBullet For My Valentine - Intro (2006)\nBullet For My Valentine - Her Voice Resides (2006)\nBullet For My Valentine - 4 Words (To Choke Upon) (2006)\nBullet For My Valentine - Tears Don't Fall (2006)\nBullet For My Valentine - Suffocating Under Words Of Sorrow (2006)\nBullet For My Valentine - Hit The Floor (2006)\nBullet For My Valentine - All These Things I Hate (Revolve Around Me) (2006)\nBullet For My Valentine - Room 409 (2006)\nBullet For My Valentine - The Poison (2006)\nBullet For My Valentine - 10 Years Today (2006)\nBullet For My Valentine - Cries In Vain (2005)\nBullet For My Valentine - Spit You Out (2006)\nBullet For My Valentine - The End (2006)\nBullet For My Valentine - Seven Days (2006)\nBullet For My Valentine - My Fist, Your Mouth, Her Scars (2006)\nBullet For My Valentine - Scream Aim Fire (2008)\nBullet For My Valentine - Eye Of The Storm (2008)\nBullet For My Valentine - Hearts Burst Into Fire (2008)\nBullet For My Valentine - Waking The Demon (2008)\nBullet For My Valentine - Disappear (2008)\nBullet For My Valentine - Deliver Us From Evil (2008)\nBullet For My Valentine - Take It Out On Me (2008)\nBullet For My Valentine - Say Goodnight (2008)\nBullet For My Valentine - End Of Days (2008)\nBullet For My Valentine - Last To Know (2008)\n\nNon career songs\n----------------\nBullet For My Valentine - Forever And Always (2008)\nBullet For My Valentine - Ashes Of The Innocent (2008)\nBullet For My Valentine - Road To Nowhere (2008)\nBullet For My Valentine - Watching Us Die Tonight (2008)\nBullet For My Valentine - One Good Reason Why (2008)\nKamelot - Love You To Death (2007)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d1eea3e3ce28397ab9fcf7fc1acc28fa859a8f6","amp;dn":"%5BWii%5D+Guitar+Hero+3+custom+-+Bullet+for+My+Valentine+and+Kamelot","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d1eea3e3ce28397ab9fcf7fc1acc28fa859a8f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,30,234,62,60,226,131,151,171,159,207,127,193,172,194,143,168,89,168,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
