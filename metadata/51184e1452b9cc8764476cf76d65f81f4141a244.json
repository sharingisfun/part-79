He is \nintelligent and cultured and he is also fascinated by tart cards \nand visits prostitutes. He will send 26 emails to his intimate \nfriend Jack, back in the US. JoeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s emails refer to cultural events, \nhis girl friends, prostitutes and background information on \ntart cards and London prostitution in general.\n \nThe emails will span January to December 2009,and will refer to events\n(theatre, cinema, exhibitions) that will occur in this year. The\ngraphics-heavy story combines text with reduced size copies of about 30\nselected tart cards for each chapter, bringing the total to about 800\ndifferent cards. Actual phone numbers were removed. Each chapter \nstarts with a humorous sketch relevant to the subject at hand.\n\nTart cards are an English metropolitan phenomenon, mostly unknown in \nprovincial England or abroad. On moral grounds, tart cards would be\nunacceptable in many European cities and certainly in North America.  \nHowever, there is academic interest in these cards and major British \ninstitutions collect them for further analysis/interpretation of the current \nsociological environment.\n\nIt is likely that the posting of tart cards will be outlawed; making the\nsprouting of tart cards in phone boxes a 20 year culture-sociological event\nthat warrants documentation and analysis.\n\nEach email focuses on a special sexual variation, with a short description\nof a visit to a prostitute engaged in that variation and a more general \ndiscussion of it:\n\nBlondes;\nPretty bum;\nWater sports; \nSchool girls; \nAdult babies; \nNationalities (cards from girls of 30 different nationalities); \nFirst names (Out of about 200 different names 30 are selected); \nAnal sex; \nEscorts and high class prostitutes; \nDomination, humiliation,\ntorture; Uniforms and fantasies; \nLeather and PVC; \nNurses, enemas, injections;\nBody to body massages; \nMature ladies; \nSubmissive girls (asking to be spanked);\nBlack girls; \nBig breasted girls (with daring pictures); \nKinky sex exploring the unconventional; \nTranssexuals; Transvestites; \nAnd as an epilogue: tart cards on themes in which the hero (Joe) has no  \nparticular interest: \nlesbians, gays and special Christmas cards.\n\nJoe also writes in more detail about themes he either found out about or\nwhich he is retelling having heard them from others. \n\nThese are: \nDomination (discipline,fetish, bondage, training, torture, complete dungeon\nequipment, parties); \nhistory and means of girls advertising; \nhow to meet and negotiate with a prostitute, including useful tips; \ndesign, creation and distribution of tart cards; \nunmentionable words on the cards; \nprostitutesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ establishments (parlours, escort agencies, clip joints,\nwalk-ups, luxury flats, street walkers); \nPoppy project analysis on number of London sex establishments, \ndistribution by nationalities etc;\n\nA dictionary of terms is included at the end of the publication.\n\nprevious messages:\nIt's massively educational. It answers loads of questions &quot;normal&quot; folk too\nshy to ask. Thanks, Andrei\nKeep up the good work. Tom\nCan't wait for the next part, Vitali\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51184e1452b9cc8764476cf76d65f81f4141a244","amp;dn":"erotic+art+prostitution+sex+London_14of26.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51184e1452b9cc8764476cf76d65f81f4141a244","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,24,78,20,82,185,204,135,100,71,108,247,109,101,248,31,65,65,162,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
