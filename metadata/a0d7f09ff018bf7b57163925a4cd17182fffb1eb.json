Forced by circumstance into being a follow-up to Round the Horne, a number of key talents from the previous show were retained and recast, with Kenneth Williams as the new show's main star.\n\n\nThe sudden death of Round the Horne star, Kenneth Horne, at the end of series four prompted a rewrite of the material intended for series five which then found its way into Stop Messing About alongside new sketches; Round the Horne writers Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke are therefore credited with series one of Stop Messing About,\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Messing_About&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Messing_About&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCast:\nKenneth Williams\nHugh Paddick\nJoan Sims\nDouglas Smith\n\n\nStop Messing About - S01 - E01 - Across The River And Into The Trees \nStop Messing About - S01 - E02 - Squire Jasper \nStop Messing About - S01 - E03 - Isadora - Time To Finish The Show \nStop Messing About - S01 - E04 - 2002 A Space Oddity - Highwayman \nStop Messing About - S01 - E05 - Oliver Stick - Searching For A Submarine \nStop Messing About - S01 - E06 - Fanny Girl - Stomach Pains \nStop Messing About - S01 - E07 - Your Place Or Mine \nStop Messing About - S01 - E08 - Sleepless \nStop Messing About - S01 - E09 - Romeo And Juliet - The Monster \nStop Messing About - S01 - E10 - Astronauts \nStop Messing About - S01 - E11 - The Adventures Of Dando Tweekshaft - Interrogation \nStop Messing About - S01 - E12 - Forced Entry \nStop Messing About - S01 - E13 - There's A Man\n\nStop Messing About - S02 - E01 - Drink Driving \nStop Messing About - S02 - E02 - The Smith Report \nStop Messing About - S02 - E03 - A Special Day \nStop Messing About - S02 - E04 - Anti-Noise Society \nStop Messing About - S02 - E05 - Hideous Creature \nStop Messing About - S02 - E06 - A Trip To Paris \nStop Messing About - S02 - E07 - The 1812 Overture \nStop Messing About - S02 - E08 - Court Ocular \nStop Messing About - S02 - E09 - Frank Sinatra \nStop Messing About - S02 - E10 - The Smiths \nStop Messing About - S02 - E11 - Cycling With No Lights \nStop Messing About - S02 - E12 - Smoking In Class \nStop Messing About - S02 - E13 - Strip Poker\n\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration Approx : 28mn 31s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0d7f09ff018bf7b57163925a4cd17182fffb1eb","amp;dn":"Stop+Messing+About+-+S01+%26+02+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0d7f09ff018bf7b57163925a4cd17182fffb1eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,215,240,159,240,24,191,123,87,22,57,37,164,205,23,24,47,255,177,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
