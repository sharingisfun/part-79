The film received a limited release in several US cities on October 9, 2009, and had a nationwide release on October 16, 2009.[7]\nThe movie centers on a young couple, Katie and Micah, who are haunted by a supernatural presence in their home. The movie is presented in the style of &quot;found footage&quot;, from the camera set up by the couple to capture what is haunting them.\nThe film has earned nearly 200 million at the US box office alone, on a reported budget of $15,000. Paranormal Activity is one of the most profitable movies ever made, based on return on investment.[8][9][10] However, such figures are difficult to verify independently[11] and are likely to exclude marketing costs.[12] The film was nominated for &quot;best first feature&quot; in the Independent Spirit Awards 2009.[13]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cf930bbefdb75f14fd70c3afdd02cd28fdf3609","amp;dn":"PARANORMAL+ACTIVITY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cf930bbefdb75f14fd70c3afdd02cd28fdf3609","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,249,48,187,239,219,117,241,79,215,12,58,253,208,44,210,143,223,54,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
