Steve, along with his West Virginia friend, Ron Elder, formed the group that initially included John Drummond, then Bobby Dennis. Then Annie stepped in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtemporarilyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for two years then, after learning that their first child was on the way, was promoted to motherhood )as she puts it) and was replaced by a band from West Monroe, Louisiana called, East Of The Altar.\n\nIn that group, made up of five men (four of which were Mark Smith, David Crockett, Stan Armor, and Mike Upshaw) was a gentleman named, Ken Fletcher. When East of The Altar returned to Louisiana, Ken stayed on, along with sound tech, Mike Upshaw. The final configuration of the musicians in Dogwood was Steve, Ron and Ken. In October 2007 they got together for the first time in 27 years and rehearsed for an event called, The Koinonia Family Reunion, held on Nov 1st.\n\nThe recording that is now available features their in-studio rehearsal and includes 12 titles, eleven of which were original Dogwood songs. Produced by Nashville's double-platinum Country Music producer (and son!), Nathan Chapman, and mixed by Scott Valezco, this recording is a state of the art remake of the original concert sound that Dogwood was known forÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦two acoustic guitars, bass, and their trio of tight vocal harmonies. \n\nFor more information on Steve Chapman and music involving his family, goto: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.steveandanniechapman.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.steveandanniechapman.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6853f35f4ed9c38a3af1fa60e8cc23828913870","amp;dn":"Dogwood","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6853f35f4ed9c38a3af1fa60e8cc23828913870","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,133,63,53,244,237,156,56,163,175,31,166,14,140,194,56,40,145,56,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
