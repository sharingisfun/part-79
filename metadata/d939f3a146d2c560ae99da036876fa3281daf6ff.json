It recounts the adventures of a young man named d'Artagnan after he leaves home to become a musketeer. D'Artagnan is not one of the musketeers of the title; those are his friends Athos, Porthos, and Aramis ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ inseparable friends who live by the motto, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOne for all, and all for oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\nThe Three Musketeers was first published in serial form in the magazine Le SiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨cle between March and July 1844. Dumas claimed it was based on manuscripts he had discovered in the BibliothÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨que Nationale. It was later proven that Dumas had based his work on the book MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©moires de Monsieur D'Artagnan, capitaine lieutenant de la premiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re compagnie des Mousquetaires du Roi (Memoirs of Mister D'Artagnan, Lieutenant Captain of the first company of the King's Musketeers) by Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras (Cologne, 1700).\nDumas' version of the story covers the adventures of D'Artagnan and his friends from 1625 to 1628, as they are involved in intrigues involving the weak King Louis XIII of France, his powerful and cunning advisor Cardinal Richelieu, the beautiful Queen Anne of Austria, her English lover, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, and the Siege of La Rochelle. Adding to the intrigue are the mysterious Milady de Winter, and Richelieu's right-hand man, the Comte de Rochefort. (Summary from Wikipedia)\n\n\n\nAn M4B file is an audio file which can be bookmarked. This is the audio-book file type. These files can have chapter markers which can be skipped through as you would skip through files on a play list. They can have built in cover art and chapter images. They will remember where you left off each time you stop the file and come back to it . And variable speed settings on Ipods and a growing number of other mp3 players can be utilized by this file type. The ability to bookmark allows for as little as one large file instead of many small ones without the burden of fast forwarding to find your spot every time you resume listening or the fear of otherwise losing your place. The reduced number of files also makes browsing through your files to find your book and your place in it much less effort.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d939f3a146d2c560ae99da036876fa3281daf6ff","amp;dn":"Librivox+M4B+Audiobook+-+Three+Musketeers+by+Alexandre+Dumas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d939f3a146d2c560ae99da036876fa3281daf6ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,57,243,161,70,210,197,96,174,153,218,3,104,118,250,50,129,218,246,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
