With this episodic take on 3 movies into 1, I wanted to create an ultimate &quot;how much can you take?&quot; fanedit. The 3 movies have a few things in common: all 3 happen in more or less 24h and in all 3 of them sweet and innocent families are tortured by violent strangers. Other than that the movies differ a lot from each other. I tried to correct that, which turns &quot;Funny Games&quot; into a serious movie, &quot;The Strangers&quot; into a less dragging one and &quot;The Last House On The Left&quot; into a &quot;less gory&quot; one. I have changed the aspect ratio and the look of the movies, so they all better fit to each other. The order of the scenes is set by the time events occur. So the fanedit starts in the morning and ends in the morning of the next day. It takes a bit of time to get used to the narration style, because you are actually watching 3 movies and it is intentional that it feels like switching from one to the other.\n\nThe release:\nThis fanedit is available as NTSC SL DVD, xvid avi and ipod ready mp4.\n\nThe DVD is very compressed but looks great. If the audience insists on a Dual Layer, I am willing to create and upload one, but I don't think it is necessary.\n\naspect ratio: 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen\n\nYour intention for this fanedit:\nmy intention? You would not have guessed it, but I want to make you suffer and put you through an experience that you will not easily forget. All 3 movies have their weaknesses, combined I think they are a lot better and really different. &quot;Funny Games&quot; was a strange horror movie that played the audience. It was draggingly slow. It had weird scenes. I know, I deleted the experimental approach from it by adding score and taking away what made it special. But now it's actually thrilling. &quot;The Strangers&quot; had its major weakness in repeating again and again the same games to cause anxiety. Even though it is the shortest of the three, it felt very long. By splitting it up and cutting away bits and pieces it gets a lot more scary. &quot;The Last House On The Left&quot; was a solid, yet standard remake that unlike the original was told as a thrilling story. But it suffers from nowadays weakness of too much unneeded gore and too streamlined scenes that we all have seen way to often. By cutting the crap I think I have reduced it to a version that has more in common with the coldness of the original.\n\nYour way to achieve your intention:\nthe usual way, which was as usual pretty unusual.\n\nHardware and software information :\nMy nice new computer.\nWomble. Goldwave. Besweet. DVD LAB PRO. Pro Show Gold. Avisynth. TMPG Xpress.\n\nWho am I?\nI am 3Raz0r, I like horror movies and I dig fanedits.\n\n\nTime needed for the edition: a few weeks (the final cut took 5 days, since I had to wait for the Last House On The Left DVD)\npersons involved: my beautiful self\n\nAdditional information links:\nimdb: (The Last House On The Left - 2009) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0844708/\n(The Strangers) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482606/\n(Funny Games US) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808279/\n\nartwork:\n\navailable: DVD, avi and mp4 onfanedit.org\navi on torrent\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:583693a065804414ff2e6e0679e7f4189a265319","amp;dn":"The+Last+Games+Of+The+Strangers+-+Scary+As+Hell+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"583693a065804414ff2e6e0679e7f4189a265319","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,54,147,160,101,128,68,20,255,46,110,6,121,231,244,24,154,38,83,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
