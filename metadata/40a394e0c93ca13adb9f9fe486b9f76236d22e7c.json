The anguished plea of the disenfranchised now begs the question, &quot;Is there anyone out there?&quot;\n\n\n\nBeyond the beguiling allure of many contemporary forms of ancient paganism, such as the New Age, Wicca, and others, many people have become attracted to a form of Hebrew mysticism known as Kabbalah. The popular press is speckled with articles of prominent Hollywood personalities who have taken up a popular contemporary version of Kabbalah\n\nIt is particularly paradoxical to find these occultic practices embedded within Judaism, despite the numerous explicit prohibitions against all forms of the occult recorded throughout the very Torah that is so highly venerated among the Jews. . .\n\n. . .Anyone with a modicum of Biblical literacy should realize that occult practices are expressly prohibited in the Scriptures. Scripture condemns by name spiritism, mediumism ('channeling'), and necromancy, and various forms of sorcery and divination, including astrology and magic. In ancient Israel, divination was a capital crime; if someone was caught casting a horoscope, or other occultic practice, they were put to death. Why?\n\nBecause God is jealous of His uniqueness, and He alone knows what the future holds. To intrude on His office is to attempt to intrude on His glory. Occult activity also courts deception and betrayal from the demonic realm, and promotes evil under the guise of legitimate religious practice. Occult involvement will eventually lead to judgement for those who refuse to forsake it.&quot;\n\nJoin Chuck as he delves deeply into the hidden world of Kabbalah and exposes the lies and traps that Satan has laid there for the unwary.\n\nBuy it from : http://store.khouse.org/store/catalog/DL112.html?mv_pc=KH66-309\n\n  ____                      _                      _   _       _\n / ___|___  _ __  ___ _ __ (_)_ __ __ _  ___ _   _| | | |_   _| |__\n| |   / _ \\| '_ \\/ __| '_ \\| | '__/ _` |/ __| | | | |_| | | | | '_ \\\n| |__| (_) | | | \\__ \\ |_) | | | | (_| | (__| |_| |  _  | |_| | |_) |\n \\____\\___/|_| |_|___/ .__/|_|_|  \\__,_|\\___|\\__, |_| |_|\\__,_|_.__/\n                     |_|                     |___/\n   ____\n  / ___|___  _ __ ___\n | |   / _ \\| '_ ` _ \\\n | |__| (_) | | | | | |\n(_)____\\___/|_| |_| |_|\n\n\nPLEASE KEEP SEEDED.
