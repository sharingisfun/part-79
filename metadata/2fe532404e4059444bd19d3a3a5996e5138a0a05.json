Keith Carradine, Powers Boothe and Peter Coyote lead a first-rate ensemble (Newsweek) in this exciting, arresting and tautly told suspenser (Variety). When nine National Guardsmen enter the Louisiana swamp for routine training, they are unaware that just a handful of their ranks will make it out alive. Through an error in judgment, they incite an all-out war with some angry Cajuns who know the territory like the backs of their hands. Armed with a precious few bullets, and confused by the dimly lit, moss-covered maze into which theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve stumbled, the innocent guardsmen know they'll be picked off one-by-one...until they come up with a solution using the only resources they have left: themselves.\n\n\n IMDb.............: http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0083111/\n\n Year.............: 1981\n Country..........: USA\n Runtime..........: 105 Minutes\n Audio............: English, French   Dolby Digital monaural\n Subtitles........: French, Spansih\n Video Format.....: NTSC \n Aspect Ratio.....:  1.85:1\n DVD Format.......: Anamorphic \n DVD Source.......: DVD5 \n DVD Distributor..: www.mgm.com/dvd\n Program..........: DVD Decrypter \n Average Bit Rate.: 4.25 Mb/sec \n\nMenus............: [x] Untouched\n                  [ ] Stripped\n\nVideo............: [x] Untouched\n                  [ ] Re-encoded\n\nDVD-extras.......: [x] Untouched\n                  [ ] Stripped\n                  [ ] Re-encoded\n                  [ ] None\n\nDVD-Audio........: [x] Untouched\n                  [ ] Stripped tracks\n\nExtras:\n .
