Today BP plans a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtop killÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ procedure to attempt to plug the geyser with cement and gas, but officials arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t exactly promising any results.  Meanwhile the Obama administration is allowing BP to call on the shots on this growing disaster, adopting the attitude that if BP canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t fix it, they probably canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t, either.\n\nMeanwhile, coastal residents are despondent and cannot understand why they have seemingly been abandoned.   In Louisana, St. Bernard Parish President Craig Taffaro said: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ . . . the plan is to let us die,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ after a visit yesterday from Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano.\n\nOther coastal parish presidents are fed up with BP and the federal government.  According to Courthouse News Service, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPlaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser said BPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s violation of the Sunday night deadline to stop using the toxic dispersant felt like a slap in the face ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAre they just going to continue spraying this stuff until someone sends them to jail?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½  Nungesser said he intends to take matters into his own hands, whether the Corps of Engineers issues his parish the emergency permit he applied for on May 13 or not, and whether BP decides help keep oil out of the wetlands or not.\n\n After 24 hours, permit or not, Nungesser said Plaquemines Parish will begin dredging and building emergency berms, as a last line of defense against oil intrusion into Plaquemines Parish marshes. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½If we donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t do it, our marsh will be destroyed,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Nungesser said.  The wetlands are prime breeding habitat for dozens or hundreds of species of wildlife, including fish, crustaceans and birds.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nBut . . . but . . . Rush said the oil is a GOOD thing for the beaches and marshes!  CanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t wait till it reaches his mansion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d782c3b2aab074592b9a31636cb1882326afa6e4","amp;dn":"Mike+Malloy+Show+-+May+25+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d782c3b2aab074592b9a31636cb1882326afa6e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,130,195,178,170,176,116,89,43,154,49,99,108,177,136,35,38,175,166,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
