William Campbell stars as a locksmith who is forced to work for a gang of thieves. The bad guys want Campbell to make duplicates of the keys to a safety deposit box containing nearly a quarter of a million dollars. As if this wasn't enough for our hero to worry about, he has to choose between his mercenary sweetheart Karen Sharpe and gang moll Anita Ekberg (poor fellow!) The film benefits from its on-location photography in and around Beverly Hills. Man in the Vault was produced by John Wayne's Batjac company, and directed by one of the Duke's favorite coworkers, Andrew V. McLaglen (son of frequent Wayne costar Victor McLaglen). ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0237603b6ba4b8a36ee8a97755c060cd7e94b83","amp;dn":"Man.in.the.Vault.1956.DVDRip.DivX-SOFILMACOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0237603b6ba4b8a36ee8a97755c060cd7e94b83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,35,118,3,182,186,75,138,54,238,138,151,117,92,6,12,215,233,75,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
