But the image of a hero in tights and a\n              feathered cap is a somewhat recent addition to the\n              myth. In reality, Robin Hood is a composite of several\n              historical figures whose exploits date back to the age\n              of the Crusades. In the film Robin Hood, starring\n              Russell Crowe, director Ridley Scott's production is\n              based on the most solid and recent historical research\n              into the character and promises a startlingly fresh\n              interpretation of Robin Hood for a new generation.\n              This special will distinguish between historical\n              evidence and Hollywood fiction, and seek to create a\n              realistic portrait of the mythical hero. Includes\n              clips from the film as well as interviews with\n              director Scott, principal Robin Hood cast members and\n              renowned historians.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        GREETS:\n                    - FQM - CTU - REVEiLLE - XOXO -","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f1e11ce01d47392878d70ef6db653f85a4fb6c6","amp;dn":"History.Channel.The.Real.Robin.Hood.720p.HDTV.x264-DHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f1e11ce01d47392878d70ef6db653f85a4fb6c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,30,17,206,1,212,115,146,135,141,112,239,109,182,83,248,90,79,182,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
