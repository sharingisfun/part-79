She is stalked and terrorized by a preacher (Anthony Perkins), while a married man (John Laughlin) slowly falls in love with her. Amid all the sleaze, kink, (which is all very necessary to the plot of the film) and talk lies an intelligent, thoughtful film. You are never able to take your eyes off Turner who is absolutely spellbinding. Perkins plays crazy like no one else can. And Laughlin and Annie Potts turn in frank, honest performances. Director Ken Russell is able to create colorful characterizations and generate memorable dialogue. The very 80's score falls perfectly into place in the film and the ending is among one of the most shocking in cinema history. A masterpiece in every respect and one of the most under rated films of all time.\n\n\n IMDb.............: User Rating of 5.9/10\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087100/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087100/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n Year.............: 1984\n Country..........: USA\n Runtime..........: 112 Minutes\n Audio............: ENGLISH (Dolby Digital Mono) + Commentary Track\n Subtitles........: English CC only\n Video Format.....: NTSC\n Aspect Ratio.....: 1.85:1\n DVD Format.......: Anamorphic\n DVD Source.......: DVD9\n DVD Distributor..: Anchor Bay\n Program..........: DVD Decrypter\n Average Bit Rate.: 6.12 Mb/sec\n\nMenus............: Untouched\nVideo............: Untouched\nDVD-extras.......:  Untouched\nDVD-Audio........:  Untouched\n\n\nExtras:\n.
