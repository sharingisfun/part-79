But unlike other books, this book, actually, offer profound answers and original solutions to the ancient problems.  Most of all, it brings new ideas and concepts: such as the INTELLECTUAL REVOLUTION as well as the IMMORTALITY ARGUMENT...\n\n\nAscertaining the Intellectual Horizon \n\nThe latest book in philosophy by the author.  A logical outcome of the previous bookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Published in 2008, it deals with various philosophical problems and presents their intricate solutions.  Not only that this book presents the Immortality Argument, thus demonstratesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½through the immense powers of philosophy and logicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that we are, in our essence, fundamentally immortal beings: which, in its significance is the single most important proof ever made; but in addition, it also shows that our world is utterly insane and that most despicable lunatics and/or morbid perverts have all the power in their deadly grasps.\nEven more significantly, it is a manifesto for intellectual revolution, when the most intelligent men should take over this doomed planet from the corrupt and the perverted sediments, from the poor servants of the rich crooks and even the wealthier thieves: as a way to develop PlatoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ideal society and NietzscheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Overman, as a way to obey the overwhelming laws of colossal nature and to fulfill our very reasons for being, our ulterior prime objective, the rudimentary Cosmic decreesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦  After all, we are the consciousness, the eyes and the mind of this universe and the realityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS:\n\n1.
