The film was previously titled They Came from Upstairs, which is instead used as the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tag line.\n\nIt all starts as a meteor shower rockets across the dark galaxy. Four glowing pods sparkle and crackle while hiding behind the meteor show. A mysterious force makes the meteor shower turn a hard right towards a bright blue ball in the distance ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ planet Earth. In a comfortable suburban house in Michigan, Stuart Pearson (Kevin Nealon) and his wife Nina (Gillian Vigman) head a family that includes adorable seven-year-old Hannah (Ashley Boettcher); 15-year-old Tom (Carter Jenkins), a techno-geek whose grades have gone south; and big sister Bethany (Ashley Tisdale), whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just returned from a secret outing with boyfriend Ricky Dillman (Robert Hoffman).\n\nsample included\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0775552/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0775552/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://moviefox.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://moviefox.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b588a9301023cca640923bf9597c6452443766ff","amp;dn":"Aliens.in.the.Attic.DVDRip.XviD-DiAMOND","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b588a9301023cca640923bf9597c6452443766ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,136,169,48,16,35,204,166,64,146,59,249,89,124,100,82,68,55,102,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
