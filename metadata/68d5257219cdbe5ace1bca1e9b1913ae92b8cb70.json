Movies; Punch 'Em In The Dick; Comic Strips; \nVan Jones.  \n\n\n\nDue to scheduling conflicts I will not be able to upload\nthe 09-18 and 09-21 shows until the evening of 09-21. So if \nsomeone can take care of that Friday and Monday I'm sure the \npests would appreciate it. Thanks!\n\nNote: I'm doing some infrastructure upgrades in \nthe next few weeks which should lead to earlier \nups. That's the good news. The bad news is I'm planning \non &quot;retiring&quot; from posting O&amp;A (it's simply a logistics\nthing) in December of this year. No point in upping\nwhen someone else could be doing it faster. That's 3 \nmonths to find a reliable O&amp;A upper to serve the pests.\n\nEdit: If worse comes to worse I can still do the 128k ups in the\nevenings post December, it's better than nothing.\n\n\n\nFor more O&amp;A try shuazien's classic episodes:    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/shuazien/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/shuazien/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDrDumb continues The Virus with Ron and Fez:    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/drdumb/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/drdumb/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPiratebay sale may happen at the end of the month!\nGet your O&amp;A here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://isohunt.com/release?poster=mothergoose56&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://isohunt.com/release?poster=mothergoose56&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBOOKMARK THIS IMMEDIATELY so you can get O&amp;A if/when tpb is gone.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68d5257219cdbe5ace1bca1e9b1913ae92b8cb70","amp;dn":"Opie+and+Anthony+2009-09-08-O%26A+CF128k+VBR+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68d5257219cdbe5ace1bca1e9b1913ae92b8cb70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,213,37,114,25,205,190,90,206,27,202,30,155,25,19,174,146,184,203,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
