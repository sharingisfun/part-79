With their acute intelligence -- including the ability to plan ahead -- these lizards are a very different kind of reptile, blurring the line between reptiles and mammals. And even though these bizarre reptiles haven't changed all that much since the dinosaurs, they are a very successful species, versatile at adapting to all kinds of settings. &quot;Lizard Kings&quot; looks at what makes these tongued reptiles so similar to mammals and what has allowed them to become such unique survivors. But while the creatures can find their way around many different habitats, finding them is no easy task. Natural loners, and always on guard, they sense anything or anyone from hundreds of feet away. NOVA follows expert lizard hunter Dr. Eric Pianka as he tracks the elusive creatures through Australia's heartland with cutting-edge &quot;lizard cam&quot;\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 56mn 20s 784ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : HDTV\nLanguage          : English\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Nature/Science\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 009 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 336 (1.810) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 130 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cc4f708dae3bcc950e1bd92df6618a980250cc7","amp;dn":"PBS+Nova-Lizard+Kings.S37E03.HDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cc4f708dae3bcc950e1bd92df6618a980250cc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,196,247,8,218,227,188,201,80,225,189,146,223,102,24,169,128,37,12,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
