Here is day 14 of the May honbasho from the RyÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½goku Kokugikan in Tokyo.  \n\nThis recording was made from digital cable through S-cable, then reprocessed to 720x480 Xvid from its original *.MPG\n\nI will not bother posting the original higher quality *.MPGs this time, as many of you prefer speed over quality (not that there is too much loss in the conversion!)  As before, I will seed until the next basho.\n\n\nPS.  This is in the secondary language: English\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07e8bdd20b3d56298bf2631852df321a140fe245","amp;dn":"Natsu+Basho+-+Day+14+-+2010+May+%28Xvid-%2A.AVI%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07e8bdd20b3d56298bf2631852df321a140fe245","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,232,189,210,11,61,86,41,139,242,99,24,82,223,50,26,20,15,226,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
