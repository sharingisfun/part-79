Cat plots to run away with Myles while Ethan decides to keep the job as his fathers assistant. Also, Christian tries to figure out where to spend the summer holidays.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a37a892eee8f1757a73206415f85f3b8d8e0f2f5","amp;dn":"Dance+Academy+-+S01E26.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a37a892eee8f1757a73206415f85f3b8d8e0f2f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,122,137,46,238,143,23,87,167,50,6,65,95,133,243,184,216,224,242,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
