I tried to explain as best as I could the steps but if there's any question feel free to ask.\nWhen you mount the image, a small .bat launches the english instructions. Then you just need to read and watch the pretty pictures.\n\nDon't ask about the stupid .iso format, I was bored I said. Just use MagicISO to mount the image or burn it onto a disc so you can keep it... I don't know do whatever you like, but share it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4862d29bba8fe20ad332d5def245a4fece36bb5a","amp;dn":"%5BRNL%5D+Adobe+CS4+EasyMod","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4862d29bba8fe20ad332d5def245a4fece36bb5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,98,210,155,186,143,226,10,211,50,213,222,242,69,164,254,206,54,187,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
