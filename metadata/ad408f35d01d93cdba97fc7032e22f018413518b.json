And lest I forget, we have the added bonus of Dexter Gordon joining in for some serious chops exchange on the aptly named blues Dexter's Deck , enjoy.\n\nPersonnel:\nHampton Hawes: piano\nHenry Franklin: bass\nMichael Carvin: drums\nDexter Gordon: tenor sax on DexterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Deck\n\nHampton Hawes - Live at the Montmartre Tracks:\n01  The Camel\n02  Little Miss Laurie\n03  Broad Blue Acres\n04  This GuyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s In Love With You\n05  Footprints\n06  Spanish Way\n07  DexterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Deck","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad408f35d01d93cdba97fc7032e22f018413518b","amp;dn":"Hampton+Hawes+-+Live+at+the+Montmartre+%281971%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bflac%5D%5Bschon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad408f35d01d93cdba97fc7032e22f018413518b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,64,143,53,208,29,147,205,186,151,252,112,50,226,47,1,132,19,81,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
