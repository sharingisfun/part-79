Mr. Gibb (Daly) is reviled among the student body as quite possibly the worst teacher ever to stand at the head of the class. He's infatuated with Ally (Panittiere), a popular teen and local celebrity. When Ally suddenly goes missing, the entire suburban town descends into panic. Could Mr. Gibb have something to do with her disappearance? When a police investigation reveals that Mr. Gibb gave Ally a ride home mere moments before she vanished without a trace, the teacher who was universally despised discovers that his troubles have only just begun.\n\n\n\n                                Mpaa Rating++++++++++\n\n           Rated R for sexual content and language. \n\n\n                                Retail Release Date++++++++\n\n                                   January 2006\n\n\n                                DVD Content++++++++++\n\n                             \n                 Main Movie+++++++++++++++\n\t              +Video- 5 passes - CCE Encoded\n\t              +Audio-English\n\t              +Subs-Spanish\n\n                 Menu+++++++\n\t              +Yes\t\n              \n                 Extras/Special Features+++++\n\t              +Yes\n\n                 Removed++++++++++++++\n\t              FBI crap and trailers and all of the other annoying and useless stuff.\n\n\n\n                 Chapters++++++++++++++\n\n1.
