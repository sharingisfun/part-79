The line-up is completed after Rogier was found, who added proper and impressive death metal vocals.\n\nAfter several live-gigs, it was time for Dark RemainsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ first feat: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDeath ManifestationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, released by the Cleansweep Productions label. This album clearly represents the style of Dark Remains; straightforward old school death metal, nothing more, nothing less.\n\nThe bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s product is inspired by bands like Immolation, (slower) Cannibal Corpse, Incantation and Autopsy. After ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDeath ManifestationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a bassplayer Rik (Warmaster) is added, and Bob (Ordo Draconis) replaces Saidi on guitar.\n\nAfter a short break, intentions for a second album lead to a deal with Burning Misery Records. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPlanet Earth ScourgedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is BobÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s and RogierÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s last contribution to the band. The latter is replaced by Erwin, a dedicated grunter from the local metalscene.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Dark Remains is featured on the compilation album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlown to Pieces Vol. 4ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nAfter a satisfactory series of shows, Rik is replaced by Alex (Warmaster), who brings along Cliff as a second guitarist. In this line-up, Dark Remains records their third album, entitled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA Construct to ObliterateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, during the start of 2009, a little over 10 years after the band began. This album is released by the Dutch Metal Records-label.\n\nThis latest album provides the listener with solid and diverse old school death metal. Slow as well as fast riffs can be heard, accompanied by raw and penetrating vocals. In the current line-up, the band is totally ready to destroy any stage with their no nonsense death metal!\n\n\nCurrent line-up \nErwin van Veldhoven - Vocals (Sucamus, Debauchery (Hol))\nFrank Kooiman (Warmaster) - Guitar\nAndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© van der Ree - Drums (Eternal Solstice, Mourning (Hol), Arcane (Hol), Warmaster)\nAlex SchlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ter - Bass (Batter, Warmaster, Mentation)\nCliff SchlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ter - Guitar (Mentation) \n\nGenre = Death Metal\nFormat = Mp3\nBit Rate = Vbr\n\nTrack Listing\n1.
