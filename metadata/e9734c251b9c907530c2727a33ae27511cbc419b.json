Thanks Mate...  And our own line audio :)\nWork done... We used a few filters on this one to help it out as it's not the best video or audio sources on this one. Used a smoother filter, sharpness filter, white balance filter, rgb eq, contrast and brightness levels... Also increased contrast as the source looked washed out.\nAnother thing... Towards the ending, there are a bit of autofocus issues in the video... \nNothing we can do about this sorry...\nNow onto the audio... This audio is not the best as we had to do some chopping \non this one. Our line had some bad areas that had to be removed, so we used \nsome cam audio that we we're given by a friend and cut in the 3 places that \nneeded it to bring you a full release... :)\n\nUPLOADER NOTES\nBRIGHT SCENES ARE WATCHABLE BUT DARK SCENES GOES OUT OF FOCUS &amp; A LITTLE DARK...AUDIO GOOD MOST OF THE MOVIE...SOME PARTS THE AUDIO IS LOW QUALITY...THERE IS ALSO SOME HISSING IN THE BACKGROUND...BUT THE BEST OUT SO FAR...OH WELL IT'S FREE...PLEASE COMMENT :)\n\nALSO FLAWL3SS &amp; IMAGiNE ARE ABOUT THE SAME SO PICK YOUR PREFERRED RELEASE GROUP :)\n\ncredit IMAGiNE &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nBIG BIG BIG GREETZ &amp; THANKS:\nALL members &amp; STAFFS of PIRATEBAY, EXTRATORRENT, KINGDOM, DEMONOID &amp; AHASHARE :)\nKaOsUSC, Motley Crue, InFeCtiouS, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, UniversalAbsurdity, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld, wrath, oziman, rubak1, BigPerm1828, skynetcentral, IZON, bluepeas, extremezone, Dibya9999, Treezluv2draw, pitic &amp; many more :)\nALL the awesome people who are SHARING (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY, even the CRITICIZERS )\n***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9734c251b9c907530c2727a33ae27511cbc419b","amp;dn":"Predators+2010+TS+READNFO+XViD+-+IMAGiNE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9734c251b9c907530c2727a33ae27511cbc419b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,115,76,37,27,156,144,117,48,194,114,122,51,174,39,81,28,188,65,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
