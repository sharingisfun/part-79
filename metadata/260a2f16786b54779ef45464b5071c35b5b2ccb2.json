It's also the prequel to Remedy's psychological action thriller Alan Wake (Xbox 360). This is all six mini-episodes merged into one 32 minute video. I also took the liberty to replace the intros/outros in between episodes with just the title for each episode. If you're experiencing playback problems, I suggest trying VLC media player.\n\nGenre: Psychological thriller / Supernatural horror\nSource: Machinima.com\nFrame rate: 24.000\nResolution: 1280 x 720\nVideo codec: AVC/H264 2-pass VBR 2.5 Mbps average, 5 Mbps max\nAudio codec: ACC 128kbps\n\nBonus clip: WTBF?! is a Machinima.com feature where five nerds analyze every little detail of the series as they try to figure out what the Bright Falls is going on out there.\n\nBright Falls soundtrack: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5570329/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:260a2f16786b54779ef45464b5071c35b5b2ccb2","amp;dn":"Alan+Wake+-+Bright+Falls+%28live-action+prequel%2C+32min%2C+720p%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"260a2f16786b54779ef45464b5071c35b5b2ccb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,10,47,22,120,107,84,119,158,244,84,100,181,7,28,53,181,178,204,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
