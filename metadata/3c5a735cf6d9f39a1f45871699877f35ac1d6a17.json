This fully realized work effectively upsets\nthis tradition by recounting a tale of oppressed 19th-century\nGerman peasants who become rebels against the state out\nof poverty, revealing (instead of romanticizing) the brutal\ndegradation of German rural life at the time. Particularly\naudacious is the presence of an itinerant Jew peddler as\nmastermind (!) of the conspiracy, predictably leading to\n(unfounded) charges of anti-semitism against a young director\nwho has dared to reintroduce the Jew into German dramaturgy.\n\nAn early work from the filmmaker behind THE TIN DRUM with an intriguing Hans Christian Anderson-style fairy tale aesthetic and voice over narration. SUDDEN WEALTH is a despairing chronicle of a group of starving peasants who finally seize governmental wealth like a dysfunctional group of Robin Hood's Merry Men, only to be betrayed by their inescapable selves and systematically dehumanized (think bucolic Orwell) and reprogrammed by what we'll put under the rubric of God and Country. Extremely striking compositions at times. Only one man (who bears a passing resemblance to a young John Cleese, incidentally) refuses to go gentle into that good night. The last scene is reminiscent of the endings in both Kubrick's PATHS OF GLORY and THE CRUCIBLE with Day-Lewis, yet all even more chilling with its alienating suddenly reappearing voice-over. SUDDEN WEALTH benefits from an especially strong second half with fuller characterization that makes it come alive as a whole for Schlondorff, whose film's evinces extremely striking compositions at times with stationary camera. Especially recommended for those interested in the New German Cinema.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img411.imageshack.us/img411/3910/bscap0140.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img411.imageshack.us/img411/3910/bscap0140.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img149.imageshack.us/img149/6433/bscap0141i.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img149.imageshack.us/img149/6433/bscap0141i.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img17.imageshack.us/img17/1014/bscap0142eh.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img17.imageshack.us/img17/1014/bscap0142eh.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img16.imageshack.us/img16/1192/bscap0143s.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img16.imageshack.us/img16/1192/bscap0143s.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img147.imageshack.us/img147/4387/bscap0144.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img147.imageshack.us/img147/4387/bscap0144.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---not my rip----\n\nFormat : AVI\nFile size : 1.37 GiB\nDuration : 1h 30mn\nOverall bit rate : 2 161 Kbps\n\nVideo\n\nWidth : 640 pixels\nHeight : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 4/3\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nResolution : 24 bits\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.255\n\nAudio\nFormat : AC-3\nBit rate : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
