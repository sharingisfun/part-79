The first episode of Entourage aired on HBO on July 18, 2004. The show is currently in its sixth season. Mark Wahlberg and Stephen Levinson serve as the show's co-executive producers, and the show's premise is loosely based on Wahlberg's experiences as an up-and-coming movie star. The series deals with themes of male friendship and with life in Hollywood. In accordance with this, numerous celebrities have guest-starred on the show. According to Mark Wahlberg, Entourage was initially conceived when his assistant asked if he could film Wahlberg and his friends, calling them &quot;hilarious&quot;. Other reports credit Eric Weinstein, a long-time friend of Wahlberg's, with the idea of filming the successful actor's group of friends.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed5c5e19f5441e4c6179e42fc5bfac21c063963f","amp;dn":"Entourage+S07E01+720p+HDTV+x264-IMMERSE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed5c5e19f5441e4c6179e42fc5bfac21c063963f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,92,94,25,245,68,30,76,97,121,228,47,197,191,172,33,192,99,150,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
