Dmitry Orlov's repeated travels to Russia throughout the early nineties allowed him to observe the aftermath of the Soviet collapse first-hand. Being both a Russian and an American, Dmitry was able to appreciate both the differences and the similarities between the two superpowers. Eventually he came to the conclusion that the United States is going the way of the Soviet Union.  His emphasis is on all the things that can still be made to work, and he advocates simply ignoring all that will fall by the wayside.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sig_garrett &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.truthnews.info&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.truthnews.info&lt;/a&gt;\n\nnote: though I did not listen to, still thought I would post.
