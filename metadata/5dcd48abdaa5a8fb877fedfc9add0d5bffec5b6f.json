It is a certain kind of psyop, to &quot;expose&quot; some small misdoing, with the intention of keeping the greater misdoings in the dark. This way, public misgivings can be satisfied while shielding the bluebloods involved from the kind of outrage that would ensue if it would learn of their actual dealings. The public outrage is being concentrated on trifles, instead on, say, the annual chairmanship of the Bilderberg Conferences by members of the Dutch (and Belgian) royal family and their contributions to the New World Order.\n\nConsider the case of the Belgian king Leopold II. In the last days of his reign, he was decried for having his way with a child. Concentrating on this vile crime, made sure that the even greater crime was obscured. Besides ravishing an innocent child for his royal pleasure, this piece of filth acquired the Congo from some fellow fiend, only to enslave the entire indigenous population, subjecting them to mass murder and starvation. In the process he robbed the natural resources of the land. When he was finished with the Congo, Leopold left a pile of dead behind consisting of somewhere between 8 and 30 million people.\n\nNow that the people are criticizing the Dutch royals for their pet projects overseas, it nevertheless presents us with an excellent opportunity to raise some real issues. The real outrage being that the Dutch royal family belongs to a network of distant and not so distant relatives bent on destroying sovereignty worldwide. If their loyalty lies anywhere, it emphatically does not lie with the nation-state they happen to rule at any one time. And it certainly is no coincidence that these lands happened to be economic strongholds of old, opening up all kinds of trading possibilities for them.\n\nThe truth that they attempt to carefully keep quiet is that the Dutch royal house, like all others festering over the European continent, stems from inbred alliances forged mainly in medieval Germany. The German house of Nassau was established way back in the dirty depths of the dark ages, later on aligning itself with the house of Orange- a rather obscure princedom in the south of France but with strong German ties. As the website of the Dutch monarchy explains:\n\n&quot;The links between the House of Nassau and the Netherlands date back to 1403 (...)&quot;.\n\nFrom this alliance sprang the current house of Orange-Nassau. And from its conception the members fanatically married into other existing nobility from the Teutonic hinterland. Consider the Prussian prince Bernhard, founder of the Bilderberg group, who wormed his way into the Dutch royal family before the Second World War, injecting it with even more Prussian blood than it had been before. Also, current queen BeatrixÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ late husband, Claus von Amsberg, was of German noble descent.\n\nThe same principle applies to the British royal family. The official website of the British monarchy readily admits the name of &quot;Windsor&quot; was an invention out of the First World War to mask the German name of old: Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.\n\n&quot;King George V&quot;, the website proclaims, &quot;replaced the German-sounding title with that of Windsor during the First World War. The name Saxe-Coburg-Gotha survived in other European monarchies (...)&quot;.\n\nThe 'other' monarchies the text is referring to, consist mainly of German houses. The Belgium monarchy traced its roots back to the very same house of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Although well documented, the official Belgian website of the royals says nothing of any German ancestry. The lack of information on their website is richly compensated by the Wikipedia entrance, destroying any questions that might linger on the subject:\n\n&quot;On 4 June (1831), Leopold of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha was designated King of the Belgians by the National Congress (...). To date all (Kings of the Belgians) have belonged to the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.&quot; History reveals it is mostly by blood that the genealogy of power is secured throughout the ages. And all those unrelated to the head snakes, have been royally approved to do evil in their name. A cast of sociopaths commanding a tribe of psychopaths.\n\nEvery single European nation has had its own private family dealing out the cards within her borders, whether it is the Oranges in Holland or the Windsors in England. If nation-states are cobwebs, than the bluebloods are the arachnids pulling all the strings. Teutonic royals overthrow sovereign nations by accumulating economic, political and military power. Always avoiding open confrontations, they seek to subdue nations quietly from within by robbing their natural resources. The double-headed eagle descended upon all lands, it seems, raising up a nationalistic faÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ade to deflect suspicion, but shielding their own dark designs toward the dismembering of all liberty: an extraordinarily old and successful formula which has now been projected to the entire globe.\n]]]]]}}}}][[[[[]][\\\\\\|||||\\|||||///////\nPAX EL BELLUM - perhaps no mercy for freedom+\n//////'''\\\\'\\\\]]]{{{^^^^^^^)[]'']==the are walking dead anyway&lt;&gt; just DEAD..\nkurwa&gt;&lt;kurwa&gt;&lt;coplete esoteric breAkdown with LED bluelights embeded in my skin.&lt;+","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dcd48abdaa5a8fb877fedfc9add0d5bffec5b6f","amp;dn":"Alex.Jones.Show.2009.10.15-sig_garrett","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dcd48abdaa5a8fb877fedfc9add0d5bffec5b6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,205,72,171,218,165,168,251,135,127,237,252,154,221,13,91,255,236,91,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
