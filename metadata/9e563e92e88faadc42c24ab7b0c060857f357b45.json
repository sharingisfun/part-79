This review session covers most basic and fundamental topics in algebra such as the concept of polynomials, synthetic division, and so on. Part 4 is a short recording of the checking of papers in the diagnostic exam given out near the end of the session; however, since there was no discussion made, there is almost nothing to be had in Part 4. Also take note that Part 1 starts hastily since I came into the class late, and might have missed around two to five minutes of discussion (however, the discussion was just about to start when I came in, apparently). Please take note as well that there might be some parts in which it seemed as if a whole part was cut. In these parts, the recorder was paused in order to save time and to keep the recordings short (if it was running when we took the exercises and the exam, it'd be much longer!).\n\nAs with all other recordings, most of the spoken language here will be in Filipino. There will be no alternate soundtrack for other languages.\n\n\nBefore anyone asks, these recordings have been executed with permission from both the authorities and the teacher. This is an original recording and has not been &quot;ripped&quot; from any source. You may seed and help distribute this file, but please do not use this for any purpose other than academic (and especially not commercial).\n\n\nEnjoy the download!\n\nErasariel","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e563e92e88faadc42c24ab7b0c060857f357b45","amp;dn":"Review+Lecture+Session+4+-+Math.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e563e92e88faadc42c24ab7b0c060857f357b45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,86,62,146,232,143,170,220,66,194,74,183,176,192,96,133,127,53,123,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
