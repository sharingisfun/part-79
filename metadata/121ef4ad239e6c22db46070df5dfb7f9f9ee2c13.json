Bulk had shown that Logan really wasn't much of a melodicist or guitarist, but his vocal and lyrical gifts are outstanding, and they're actually sharper here than they had been on Bulk. Tunes like the opening &quot;Teach Me the Rules&quot; and the mysterious &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen&quot; are lyrically evocative and musically memorable, and the full-band arrangements make this a richer-sounding album than the sometimes too Spartan Bulk. Most impressively, Keneipp  and the rest of Liquor Cabinet are able to keep the &quot;friends hanging out and playing in the garage&quot; vibe that made Bulk so refreshing. An unpretentious but deeply satisfying album, Mood Elevator sounds like a more relaxed Wilco  or Guided By Voices with a good editor and a far better work ethic. It didn't get the press Bulk did, but, in the long run, it's a better album. \n\n01. Teach Me the Rules \n02. Unscathed \n03. Chinese Lorraine \n04. When It All Comes Down\n05. My New Town \n06.
