So I did something about it.\n\nThis is all the Penn Says You.Tube videos, painstakingly downloaded by me from You.Tube through a proxy, and numbered for your convenience. It is up-to-date as of September 4, 2009. Now you can get ALL the past videos at once, without any hassle. Or you can get only the specific ones you want. Enjoy!\n\nNote: This has only the Penn Says videos from the You.Tube channel. There are more on crackle dot com, but they are not in this torrent. I don't know how to download/sort through those.\n\nI tried uploading this before, but I didn't realize how crippled my internet connection was at the time. And yes, I did add the videos that came between then and now. Please seed after you download! Thanks! \n\nBy the way, what the FUCK is up with the censoring of the word &quot;You.Tube&quot; (if entered without the dot in the middle). That is fucking retarded.\n\n\nList of the videos:\n\n001 - Obama and 24\n002 - Jonas Brothers\n003 - Ratso\n004 - Selling votes on Ebay\n005 - Agnostic vs. Atheist\n006 - Bullshit Symbolism\n007 - Boy Scouts Coin\n008 - Pornography and Reality TV\n009 - Pain\n010 - Objective Reality\n011 - Vinnie the Puke\n012 - Superman and the KKK\n013 - Guns and Freedom\n014 - I don't know\n015 - New York vs. San Fransisco\n016 - Krab\n017 - I'll Be a Blue Nosed Gopher\n018 - Harvard (Cock)\n019 - Bee Balls\n020 - Hillary Wants Obama to Lose\n021 - The Party of Hate\n022 - Cynicism\n023 - Viewer Mail - Welcome to You.Tube Edition\n024 - Viewer Mail Wrap Up\n025 - Sarah Palin Jokes\n026 - Overpaying Your Taxes\n027 - Paying for Planetariums\n028 - Don't Watch the Debate\n029 - You Can't Vote Against\n030 - Barack's Unfortunate Middle Name\n031 - Sam Harris\n032 - Numb3ers Politics\n033 - &amp; Teller 2\n034 - Large Pumpkins &amp; Voting\n035 - Sending CDs to the Military\n036 - I Hate Daylight Savings\n037 - Viewer Mail - Don't Watch the Debate\n038 - Bee Wall\n039 - Election Day\n040 - The Rules for Produce\n041 - My Father's Match House\n042 - Parenting Doesn't Matter\n043 - New York vs. Las Vegas\n044 - Soccer Dad\n045 - Remembering My Sister\n046 - A Jewish Man's First Bacon\n047 - Shower Scene\n048 - Is This A Great Episode Or What\n049 - Good Music I Don't Like (and Hand Jobs)\n050 - John Rael Giving Away His Vote\n051 - Esperanto\n052 - Grammar\n053 - Atheist Quakers\n054 - Desert Bus Charity\n055 - Click Language\n056 - It's Good To Be a Kid\n057 - A Gift of a Bible\n058 - Cheating On My Jazz Partner\n059 - Christmas\n060 - High Diving With David Blaine\n061 - Santa and My Kids\n062 - Faith Heckle\n063 - BandAid\n064 - Viewer Mail - Abortion\n065 - Viewer Mail - Corporate Bailouts &amp; Obama\n066 - Tom Bergeron and Ayyan Hirsi Ali\n067 - Slumdog Millionaire Review\n068 - Playboy and Aging\n069 - The Best Heckle I Ever Heard\n070 - Painting a Joke on a Turtle\n071 - Synecdoche-- A Review &amp; Discussion\n072 - Vegas Snow and Al Gore\n073 - Snow Juggling\n074 - I'm Not Going to See Bad Shows Anymore\n075 - The Wrestler\n076 - Come Together\n077 - Worst Assistant For Bullet Trick\n078 - 2008 Wrap-Up - Films\n079 - I'm 600 Feet Tall\n080 - God and the Inauguration\n081 - 2008 Wrap-up: Books\n082 - 2008 Wrap-up: Live Shows\n083 - In the Air\n084 - 2008 Wrap-up: Home Video\n085 - Requests for the No God Band\n086 - Early George Carlin\n087 - Respect for Christians\n088 - Unintended Consequences\n089 - Stem Cell Research\n090 - Pledging to be a Servant\n091 - What's the Harm?\n092 - Is Dissent Still Patriotic?\n093 - A New Perspective\n094 - Surrounded by Patriotism\n095 - I Don't Think I'm a Cynic\n096 - Viral\n097 - Viewer Mail - Jesus Camp\n098 - Viewer Mail - David Blaine\n099 - Viewer Mail - My Children's Names\n100 - Dr. Seuss\n101 - Bullshit: The Nude Girl\n102 - Bullshit: Rescuing a Go-Go Dancer\n103 - Praying Around Atheists\n104 - Bullshit: Speaking for Catholics\n105 - Viewer Mail - Hell House\n106 - George Carlin and Fred Phelps\n107 - Legalize Marijuana\n108 - Israel and the Pope\n109 - Viewer Mail - Proposition 8\n110 - Help Me Write Something for Glenn Beck\n111 - Bull Bullshit\n112 - Viewer Mail - Knowing There's No God\n113 - Lawyer Love\n114 - Penn &amp;\n115 - Dick Dale\n116 - Turning 54\n117 - Painting My Fingernail\n118 - A Chance to Fuck Elvis\n119 - If You Seek Amy\n120 - Flame War\n121 - Katy Perry\n122 - Trillion\n123 - Zappa Plays Zappa\n124 - Madonna\n125 - Qualified\n126 - Larry King\n127 - Counter Intuitive\n128 - Rush Limbaugh\n129 - Viewer Mail - Being a Beekeeper\n130 - Kelly Carlin\n131 - Glenn Beck's Tea Party at the Alamo\n132 - Ask Not?\n133 - TAM 7\n134 - Atheist Parenting\n135 - Un-Baptized\n136 - The Audacity of No Hope\n137 - IKEA\n138 - Naked Elvis Baptism\n139 - A Fantastic Compliment\n140 - Looking for a Guy Like Penn\n141 - Stories About Breast Milk\n142 - Correction to &quot;Audacity of No Hope&quot;\n143 - The NEA Ruined Famous Artists\n144 - Prayer Test\n145 - Skeptic Article\n146 - Fireman Sex Aid\n147 - Messing With Our Show\n148 - Twittering\n149 - JREF Million Dollar Challenge\n150 - The Soloist\n151 - A Fatal Bullet Catch\n152 - Japanese Rape Game\n153 - Calling Atheists Less Than Human\n154 - Sexting\n155 - Godless Girl Guides\n156 - Imagine Moxie\n157 - Shecky Greene\n158 - Up!
