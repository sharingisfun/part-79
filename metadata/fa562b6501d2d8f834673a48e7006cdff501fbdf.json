Picked this one as a test pilot 'cause I didn't see any recent Seger posted on TPB. Plus, had it ready to go, anyway.\nI can already hear the screaming. bitching &amp; moaning..... &quot;Why Fraunhofer?? ....why not LAME?.....why not FLAC?.....boo-hoo-hoo...waa-waa.&quot;\nActually, LAME has become my encoder of choice for lossy recently, not for quality issues.....both are fine encoders, but the open source format offers a much wider variety of options.  As far as this upload goes, I already had these ripped a couple of years ago. (lazy) :)\nAnyhoo, hope this works &amp; somebody enjoys it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa562b6501d2d8f834673a48e7006cdff501fbdf","amp;dn":"Bob+Seger%5C%27s+Greatest+%231+%26+%232+.++297+mb%40320+cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa562b6501d2d8f834673a48e7006cdff501fbdf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,86,43,101,1,210,216,248,52,103,58,72,231,0,108,223,245,1,251,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
