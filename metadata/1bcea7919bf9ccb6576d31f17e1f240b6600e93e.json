As the group races toward the mysterious mountain in the Nevada desert that has mystified scientists and paranormal researchers for years, the government, gangsters, and an extraterrestrial bounty hunter attempt to prevent them from reaching their intended destination. Should the two planetary travelers fail in recovering their ship, an alien invasion will be launched against the entire planet. The original 1975 picture Escape to Witch Mountain was followed by the sequel Return From Witch Mountain, as well as a 1995 made-for-TV remake. ~ Jeremy Wheeler, All Movie Guide\n\n\n\nTheatrical Feature Running Time: 99 mins \nComplete Cast:\nDwayne Johnson - Jack Bruno\nAlexander Ludwig - Seth\nCiarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n Hinds - Burke\nChris Marquette - Pope\nGarry Marshall - Dr. Donald Harlan\nCheech Marin - Eddie\nTom Woodruff, Jr. - Siphon\nJohn Duff - Frank\nBob Clendenin - Lloyd\nBeth Kennedy - Stenftenagel\nHarry Murphy - Analyst D.
