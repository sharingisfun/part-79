The lecture briefly covers major topics in biology, and then includes the discussions to the three refresher exams that were given after the discussion. It's around three hours total, so you might want to listen to this in breaks, transit, or just plain resting after studying. Be reminded that the quality is not that great since there is much background noise, but most of the voices are audible.\n\nPlease do take note that this lecture is in Filipino, mostly. There *are* parts in which the lecture is in English, but I strongly recommend having a good understanding of the language before attempting to download. No, there are no alternate soundtracks.\n\nBefore anyone asks, these recordings have been executed with permission from both the authorities and the teacher. This is an original recording and has not been &quot;ripped&quot; from any source. You may seed and help distribute this file, but please do not use this for any purpose other than academic (and especially not commercial).\n\nEnjoy the download!\n\nErasariel","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e12dcf8f7602abe1a8617a489ad45a1935d471ab","amp;dn":"Review+Lecture+Session+2+-+Biology.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e12dcf8f7602abe1a8617a489ad45a1935d471ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,45,207,143,118,2,171,225,168,97,122,72,154,212,90,25,53,212,113,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
