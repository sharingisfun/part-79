The Upstream Vendor has also added freeradius2 and postgresql84, as well as updated OpenOffice to 3.1.1.\nFor the full list of what we have added, or updated, please see the release notes.\n\nWe want to thank everyone who has contributed, tested, and given us feedback. We say that every time, but we really mean it. Many of the features in Scientific Linux come from our community. Without everyone's contributions, help and testing, this release wouldn't be as good as it is.\n\nScientific Linux release 5.5 is based on the rebuilding of RPMS out of SRPMS's from Enterprise 5 Server and Client, including Update 5. It also has all errata and bugfixes up until the morning of May 18, 2010.\n\n\n\nRelease note: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ftp.scientificlinux.org/linux/scientific/55/i386/SL.releasenote&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ftp.scientificlinux.org/linux/scientific/55/i386/SL.releasenote&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nErrata: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ftp.scientificlinux.org/linux/scientific/5x/x86_64/updates/security/repoview/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ftp.scientificlinux.org/linux/scientific/5x/x86_64/updates/security/repoview/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nFor more infos look here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.scientificlinux.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.scientificlinux.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nHave a lot of fun!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa4caf0ded1f04a79af4f6becbd83e13d6314977","amp;dn":"Scientific+Linux+5.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa4caf0ded1f04a79af4f6becbd83e13d6314977","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,76,175,13,237,31,4,167,154,244,246,190,203,216,62,19,214,49,73,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
