Made \nfamous by the Essential Clubsound CDs, Manuel Schleis &amp; Manuel Reuter from \ngermany have created many great sample packs for music producers to use to \ncreate musical masterpieces. Most songs you here there will always be some \nsounds from the very popular Vengeance. And now I bring them together from \neveryone to enjoy.\n\n-------- ATTENTION : FEED THE NEED, PLEASE SEED --------\n\n  If you like and use the contents of this package, give\nsomething back so others can enjoy it by seeding it for\nawhile. I am currently seeding 25 torrents, some of them\nI don't even use that often.\n________________________________________________________\n\n  This pack contains these Vengeance Packages:\n--------------------------------------------------------\n   Pack Name | # of Samples/Kits | Sample Format\n--------------------------------------------------------\n  VEC Vol. 1 | 2500              | WAV\n  VEC Vol. 2 | 2500              | WAV\n  VEC Vol. 3 | 2600+             | WAV\n  VFX Vol. 1 | 750+              | WAV\n  VFX Vol. 2 | 750+              | WAV\n  VUB Vol. 1 | 750               | WAV\n  VEH Vol. 1 | 2400+             | WAV\n  VEH Vol. 2 | 2400+             | WAV\n  VMH Vol. 1 | 2400+             | WAV\n  VEE Vol. 1 | 2400+             | WAV\n  VVE Vol. 1 | 1500+             | MP3\n  VFH Vol. 1 | 40 Kits           | WAV\n  VFH Vol. 2 | 40 Kits           | WAV\n________________________________________________________\n(I hope you know the abbreviations)\n\n  Sorry, but this pack does NOT contain Vengeance Electro Essentials Vol. \n2, I could not find it anywhere! But fortunatley that IS the only pack \nthis collection does not contain.\n\n  Each pack contains all of the sounds (of course) in WAV format (except \nfor VVE, that's in MP3, I don't know why), the demo songs, and the front and back CD cover image. This collection is in ISO format, so just uncompress or mount the \n.ISO CD image file with PowerISO. If you don't have it, buy it (or option \n2, you know what I mean).\n\n  What I usually do with Sample Packs is put it on the folder of my FL \nStudio patches in a folder called &quot;Samples&quot; (C:Program FilesImage-\nLineFL Studio 9DataPatchesSamples), so I can easily navigate through \nthem in the FL browser. Then I just drop them onto the step sequencer.\n\n  It's a good idea, when using these samples, to put a reverb and/or a \ndelay on them, as well as a chorus sometimes. You should also loop them \nwith loop points (if they aren't looped already) using the Edison wave \neditor that comes with FL, or crossfade-looping using the sampler. The \nsamples aren't as useful without these effects.\n\nHave fun with all of the samples!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bb82aa327f70bd65b0116aba25b35a37b41a1cf","amp;dn":"Vengeance+Samples+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bb82aa327f70bd65b0116aba25b35a37b41a1cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,184,42,163,39,247,11,214,91,1,22,171,162,91,53,163,123,65,161,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
