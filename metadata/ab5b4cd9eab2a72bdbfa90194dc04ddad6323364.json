These are the same drivers bundled with the DVD. In case you lost your copy. Snow Leopard features slightly new drivers such as HFS+ read/write support so you may want to find those instead.\n\nThese drivers are specifically for model MacBook5,2. You can find the model in OS X by clicking Apple/About This Mac/More Info/Hardware. This was the white model for sale between January and April 2009. The model is similar to every Macbook White version and drivers may work on others, but is untested.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab5b4cd9eab2a72bdbfa90194dc04ddad6323364","amp;dn":"Boot+Camp+drivers+%28Macbook5%2C2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab5b4cd9eab2a72bdbfa90194dc04ddad6323364","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,91,76,217,234,178,167,43,219,250,144,25,77,192,77,218,214,50,51,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
