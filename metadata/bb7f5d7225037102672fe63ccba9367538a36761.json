Praeludium in G Major \n \nTon Koopman - The Bielfeldt organ (1736), St. Wilhadi, Stade, Germany \n\nThis is the tenth recording in the outstanding series of the complete works of Dieterich Buxtehude by Ton Koopman and the fifth and final part of the organ works. It presents a selection which contains the remainder of BuxtehudeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s organ works of the two major categories, free and chorale-based compositions, alongside the complete organ works of Nicolaus Bruhns (1665-1697). Bruhns was BuxtehudeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most gifted pupil and was an important figure in the development of BuxtehudeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s style of composition. BuxtehudeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s organ works are his most significant contribution to the history of music. They consist of a comprehensive body of 90 compositions, of which more than half are chorale settings. \n \nThe organ featured on this 2CD set is one of only two surviving organs by Erasmus Bielfeldt and has been restored on the basis of the great organ building art of the baroque in 1990 by Ahrend.  \n \nTon Koopman is one of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s foremost early music keyboard specialists and directors. He is president of the International Dieterich Buxtehude Society and one of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s leading authorities on his music.\nDieterich Buxtehude (1637-1707)\n\nDietrich Buxtehude, a key figure of the baroque period, was born in 1637. Originally taught organ by his father, Buxtehude went on to become organist at St. MaryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Church in LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼beck, Germany. He took up the post in 1668 and in the 1670ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s he introduced sacred dramatic performances to the Abendmusicken or evening concerts of the church. The performances attracted musicians from far and wide and became a longstanding feature of the church. Bach, Handel, and many others made the pilgrimage to meet Buxtehude and were inspired and influenced by him.\nAlthough Buxtehude is known for his organ works, he also wrote a wide variety of vocal music and some chamber works. Two collections of chamber sonatas were the only works published in BuxtehudeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lifetime and many of his compositions are thought to have been lost. However, his organ works, which mainly focus on chorale settings and large-scale sectional forms, were destined to become core works of the organ repertoire and continue to feature in church services and recitals.\nGramophone Magazine\nEditor's Choice - September 2009\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb7f5d7225037102672fe63ccba9367538a36761","amp;dn":"Opera+Omnia+X+-+Organ+Works+Vol.+5++Buxtehude","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb7f5d7225037102672fe63ccba9367538a36761","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,127,93,114,37,3,113,2,103,47,230,60,203,169,54,117,56,163,103,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
