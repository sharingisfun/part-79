It stars Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, and Val Kilmer. The film was released on December 15, 1995.\n\nDe Niro plays Neil McCauley, a professional burglar who is a calm and methodical introvert, while Pacino plays Lt. Vincent Hanna, veteran LAPD homicide detective whose explosive temper and devotion to his job causes him to neglect those closest to him. The central conflict of the film was based on the experiences of former Chicago police officer Chuck Adamson and his pursuit of a criminal named McCauley in the 1960s, from which the name of De Niro's character was derived.\n\nThe film is technically a remake of L.A. Takedown, a 1989 made-for-television film which was also written and directed by Mann; Mann had been trying to get Heat made for over a decade, and created L.A Takedown as a simplified version after his efforts were unsuccessful. Heat was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $187 million worldwide.\n              \n\n                                    +-+-+-+-+\n                                    |c|a|s|t|\n                                    +-+-+-+-+\n                                         \n                  Actor                              Role\n\n                  Al Pacino ........................
