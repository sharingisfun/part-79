Circle Of Life\nI know Elton sells soundboards of his shows now, and I think that is great. In fact, I have purchased this show, but if you read the write up from the website, even the CDs are from 320 kbps sources. I would not share this if it was not a good recording. I had a great seat about twenty feet from Elton. After all the years of taping Elton I finally get a good recording and Elton is selling SBDs. Go figure. This is a full fidelity recording, not lossy, and I wonder if the SBD can really capture the power of the bottom end that this tape has. Tracks done on the fly so they are not perfect, especially the start of Tiny Dancer. I removed most of the encore wait/autograph session or else it would not have fit on 2 CDs. The show lasted over 160 minutes. This was one of the strongest Elton shows I have seen. Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e4f00ab8dd71ee946603e2e2d35aa52ce62f84c","amp;dn":"Elton+John-Austin%2C+TX+April+10%2C+2010-Audience+Source-DPA+4061","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e4f00ab8dd71ee946603e2e2d35aa52ce62f84c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,79,0,171,141,215,30,233,70,96,62,46,45,53,170,82,206,98,248,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
