They are being constructed by Nakheel Properties, a property developer in the United Arab Emirates, who hired Belgian and Dutch  dredging and marine contractor Jan De Nul and Van Oord, some of the world's specialists in land reclamation. The islands are the Palm Jumeirah, the Palm Jebel Ali and the Palm Deira.\n\n       Each settlement will be in the shape of a palm tree, topped with a crescent, and will have a large number of residential, leisure and entertainment centers. The Palm Islands are located off the coast of The United Arab Emirates in the Persian Gulf and will add 520 kilometres of beaches to the city of Dubai.\n\n        The first two islands will comprise approximately 100 million cubic meters of rock and sand. Palm Deira will be composed of approximately 1 billion cubic meters of rock and sand. All materials will be quarried in the UAE. Among the three islands there will be over 100 luxury hotels, exclusive residential beach side villas and apartments, marinas, water theme parks, restaurants, shopping malls, sports facilities and health spas.\n\n         The creation of the Palm Jumeirah began in June 2001. Shortly after, the Palm Jebel Ali was announced and reclamation work began. The Palm Deira, which is planned to have a surface area of 46.35 square kilometres, was announced for development in October 2004. Construction was originally planned to take 10ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“15 years, but that was before the impact of the global credit crunch hit Dubai.\n\nGeneral\n-----------\nFile size......................: 352 MiB\nDuration.......................: 46mn 23s\nOverall bit rate...............: 1 060 Kbps\n\nVideo\n------------\nFormat.........................: AVC\nFormat/Info....................: Advanced Video Codec\nFormat settings, ReFrames......: 2 frames\nCodec ID.......................: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nBit rate.......................: 879 Kbps\nNominal bit rate...............: 890 Kbps\nWidth..........................: 704 pixels\nHeight.........................: 448 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio...........: 1.571\nFrame rate.....................: 25.000 fps\nResolution.....................: 24 bits\nBits/(Pixel*Frame).............: 0.111\nWriting library................: x264 core 79\n\nAudio\n--------------\nID.............................: 2\nFormat.........................: MPEG Audio\nFormat version.................: Version 1\nFormat settings, Mode..........: Joint stereo / MS Stereo\nCodec ID.......................: A_MPEG/L3\nCodec ID/Hint..................: MP3\nBit rate.......................: 160 Kbps\nChannel(s).....................: 2 channels\nSampling rate..................: 48.0 KHz\nResolution.....................: 16 bits\n----------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b01be8cae80fff7e0419b66ef55dd2676fe93c3c","amp;dn":"str+and+construction+of+palm+island+H264+devhx","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b01be8cae80fff7e0419b66ef55dd2676fe93c3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,27,232,202,232,15,255,126,4,25,182,110,245,93,210,103,111,233,60,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
