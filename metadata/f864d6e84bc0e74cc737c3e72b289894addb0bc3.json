There were a number of unforgettable performances at Mexico City Olympic Games and many world records were broken, but the enduring image from the 1968 Games was when African-American athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised their gloved clenched fists in support of the Black Panther movement during the playing of the Star Spangled Banner, after receiving gold and bronze medals for the 200m sprint. They were subsequently banned from the Games for life. \n\nThis documentary asks what inspired them to make their protest, why it carried such a powerful message and what happened to the unlikely revolutionaries following the Games. \n\nDuration:60 minutes\n\nACodec:  MP3 (128-mono)\nVCodec:  XviD (2 pass MPEG)\n\nPls. help seed to keep torrent alive!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f864d6e84bc0e74cc737c3e72b289894addb0bc3","amp;dn":"BBC+1968+Olympics+Black+Power+Salute+XviD+MP3.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f864d6e84bc0e74cc737c3e72b289894addb0bc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,100,214,232,75,192,231,76,199,55,195,231,43,40,152,148,173,219,11,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
