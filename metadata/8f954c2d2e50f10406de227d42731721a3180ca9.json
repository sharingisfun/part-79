Between 1914 and 1920, about 80,000 Ukrainian immigrants were forced to register as &quot;enemy aliens,&quot; report regularly to the police, and carry government-issued identity papers at all times. Over 5,000 of their compatriots suffered an even more severe fate, imprisoned in internment camps across the country. Treatment was often harsh, and conditions grim. Some died in the camps, many were sick or injured, and several were killed by guards while trying to escape. By means of archival footage, vintage photographs, the compelling testimony of survivors, and the commentary of such prominent Canadian historians as Desmond Morton and Donald Avery, award-winning filmmaker Yurij Luhovy weaves a moving human story of Canadian history that has all but disappeared from public consciousness.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/collection/film/?id=32014&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/collection/film/?id=32014&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFile Name:............Freedom.Had.A.Price.avi\nRuntime:..............00:55:06\nFilesize:.............700.06 MB\n\nLanguage:.............English \nSubtitles:............None\n\nVideo codec:..........XviD MPEG-4 codec\nVideo aspect ratio:...1.33:1\nVideo width x height:.640 x 480\nVideo framerate:......29.970 FPS\nVideo bitrate:........1648 KB/s\n\nAudio type:...........MPEG-1 Layer 3 (MP3)\nAudio channels:.......2 Ch\nAudio sample rate:....48000 Hz\nAudio bitrate:........128 KB/s (CBR)\n\n*Note: Old VHS tape from Library.\n\n-----please seed-----\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f954c2d2e50f10406de227d42731721a3180ca9","amp;dn":"Freedom+Had+A+Price","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f954c2d2e50f10406de227d42731721a3180ca9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,149,76,45,46,80,241,4,6,222,34,125,66,115,23,33,163,24,12,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
