Swoff and his fellow Marines sustain themselves with sardonic humanity and wicked comedy on blazing desert fields in a country they don't understand against an enemy they can't see for a cause they don't fully fathom... Sergeant Sykes is a Marine lifer who heads up Swofford's scout/sniper platoon, while Troy is Swoff's friend and mentor, a die-hard member of STA - their elite Marine Unit.\n\nRelease Date: 2005\n\nStarring Jake Gyllenhaal and Jamie Foxx.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df6ba384b85a7a5eea8aff214a2afaa540e066f2","amp;dn":"Jarhead","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df6ba384b85a7a5eea8aff214a2afaa540e066f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,107,163,132,184,90,122,94,234,138,255,33,74,42,250,165,64,224,102,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
