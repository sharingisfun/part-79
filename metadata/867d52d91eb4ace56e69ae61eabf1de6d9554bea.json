Rosen has spent years studying and writing about this unique music and it is immediately apparent in these magnificent recordings. His interpretation is peerless and his mastery and technique infallable despite the rugged difficulty of Beethoven's late piano music. \n\nThe &quot;Hammerklavier&quot; performance is wonderful, and every nuance is shaped logically and artistically despite the extreme challenges found almost everywhere in this profound work. Rosen is able to do the near impossible, which is to &quot;own&quot; this unusual and deeply expressive music. He doesn't just play it, he lives it as though every impulse in his mind and body is focused on expressing this &quot;symphony&quot; for piano. \n\nThe sound is top notch, and Rosen's instrument has a very rich and present sonority. Recommended without any reservation whatsoever. If you are interested in Beethoven, here is his music played in such a manner that you will find yourself completely absorbed in his unique and powerful musical world.\n\n\n\n\nTrack List\n\n[Disk 1]\n\n01) Sonata 27 in E minor, Op 90, 1 - Mit Lebhaftigkeit und durchaus mit Empfindigkeit und Ausdruck [05:40]\n02) Sonata 27 in E minor, Op 90, 2 - Nicht zu geschwind und sehr singbar vorgetragen [08:43]\n03) Sonata 28 in A major, Op 101, 1 - Allegretto ma non troppo [04:43]\n04) Sonata 28 in A major, Op 101, 2 - Vivace alla marcia [06:20]\n05) Sonata 28 in A major, Op 101, 3 - Adagio ma non troppo, con affetto [03:08]\n06) Sonata 28 in A major, Op 101, 4 - Allegro [07:45]\n07) Sonata 30 in E major, Op 109, 1 - Vivace, ma non troppo [03:49]\n08) Sonata 30 in E major, Op 109, 2 - Prestissimo [02:19]\n09) Sonata 30 in E major, Op 109, 3 - Andante molto cantabile ed espressivo [14:04]\n10) Sonata 31 in Ab major, Op 110, 1 - Moderato cantabile molto espressivo [07:13]\n11) Sonata 31 in Ab major, Op 110, 2 - Allegro molto [02:11]\n12) Sonata 31 in Ab major, Op 110, 3 - Adagio ma non troppo - Fuga - Allegro ma non troppo [12:00]\n\n\n[Disk 2]\n\n01) Sonata 29 in B-flat major, Op. 106 (&quot;Hammerklavier&quot;) - Allegro [10:40]\n02) Sonata 29 in B-flat major, Op. 106 (&quot;Hammerklavier&quot;) - Scherzo - Assai vivace [02:31]\n03) Sonata 29 in B-flat major, Op. 106 (&quot;Hammerklavier&quot;) - Adagio sostenuto - Appassionato e con molto sentimento [18:24]\n04) Sonata 29 in B-flat major, Op. 106 (&quot;Hammerklavier&quot;) - Largo - Allegro risoluto [11:57]\n05) Sonata 32 in C minor, Op. 111 - Maestoso - Allegro con brio ed appassionato [09:07]\n06) Sonata 32 in C minor, Op. 111 - Arietta - Adagio molto semplice e cantabile [19:27]\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:867d52d91eb4ace56e69ae61eabf1de6d9554bea","amp;dn":"Beethoven+-+The+Late+Piano+Sonatas+-+Charles+Rosen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"867d52d91eb4ace56e69ae61eabf1de6d9554bea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,125,82,217,30,180,172,229,110,105,174,97,234,191,29,230,217,85,75,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
