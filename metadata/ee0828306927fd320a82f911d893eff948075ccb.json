Here is day 15, the final day for some to get Katchi-koshi of the May honbasho from the RyÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½goku Kokugikan in Tokyo.  Good luck to all your favourites!\n\nThis recording was made from digital cable through S-cable, then reprocessed to 720x480 Xvid from its original *.MPG\n\nI will not bother posting the original higher quality *.MPGs this time, as many of you prefer speed over quality (not that there is too much loss in the conversion!)  As before, I will seed until the next basho.\n\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be around for the next basho, so ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“seeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ you all in July\n\n\nLanguage: JAPANESE\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee0828306927fd320a82f911d893eff948075ccb","amp;dn":"Natsu+Basho+%5BJAPANESE%5D-+Day+15+-+2010+May+%28Xvid-%2A.AVI%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee0828306927fd320a82f911d893eff948075ccb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,8,40,48,105,39,253,50,10,130,249,17,216,147,239,249,72,7,92,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
