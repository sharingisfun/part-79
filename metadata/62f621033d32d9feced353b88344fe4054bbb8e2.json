As an offshoot of anonymous confession site Grouphug.us, episodes typically featured phoned in stories of hysterical lasciviousness and unspeakable shame, mixed with segments such as Half-Assed Movie Review, Into It/Not Into It and Noodly Hoodly Doodly. International correspondants Shithound, Matt of the Relm, Drinkey Pig Georgia and Ricksta add the Web 2.0 flavour of interactivity, while providing a body of evidence against alcohol consumption.
