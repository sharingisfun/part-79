The Stooges have been a constant influence throughout SternÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s legendary radio career, inspiring conversations, comedy bits and constant references to their genius.\n\nIn May 2009, during his interview with Dancing with the Stars host Tom Bergeron, Howard learned that as a teenager in the 70ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s, Bergeron had the chance to actually interview two of the original Three Stooges, Moe Howard and Larry Fine. Bergeron noted that he even recorded the conversations but didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know the exact location of these precious tapes. Howard responded to Tom that if he could find these sacred recordings, he would create an exclusive special to showcase the interviews on his channels at Sirius XM Radio.\n\nTom Bergeron went home and found the tapes.\n\nHoward Stern and Sirius XM Radio are proud to present an exciting new special, The Three Stooges: Lost and Found Interviews. Hosted by Emmy Award winner Tom Bergeron, The Three Stooges: Lost and Found Interviews features TomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s extremely rare interviews he conducted as a teenager with Moe Howard and Larry Fine as well as the unique stories behind them. On the tapes, both Moe and Larry discuss the history of the Stooges plus the Curly/Shemp/Curly-Joe/Joe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthird stoogeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ evolution. Larry reminisces about working with Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, in one memorable moment, Moe takes a swipe at legendary comedians Jerry Lewis and Bob Hope. (Knuckleheads!) The interview with Larry Fine was done just months before his death in 1975.\n\nIn addition to these priceless interviews, host Tom Bergeron will highlight some of The Howard Stern ShowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s greatest Stooge-themed moments from HowardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s personal radio archive including a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBeaver BreakÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from 1982, the Stern Show gang playing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThree StoogesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ trivia, Howard reflecting on watching the Stooges with his father Ben Stern as well as several legendary bits from the mid-90ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s featuring the Stern ShowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s master Larry Fine impressionist, Billy West.\n\nThe Three Stooges: Lost and Found Interviews hosted by Tom Bergeron will air on Friday, July 31st at 2:00pm ET on Howard 101.\n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a must-hear for Stooge and Stern fans alike.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fbd61c7bb9f6aeba0ca2ade4556f58138262782","amp;dn":"Howard_Stern_128k_Three_Stooges_Special-cf%28wush%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fbd61c7bb9f6aeba0ca2ade4556f58138262782","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,189,97,199,187,159,106,235,160,202,42,222,69,86,245,129,56,38,39,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
