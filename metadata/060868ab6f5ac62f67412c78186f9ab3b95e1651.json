They currently release their music under K-Murdock's imprint, Neosonic Productions.\n\nCombining old-school rhyming with soulful beats, the Washington D.C. duo Panacea have drawn comparisons to revered hip-hoppers like the Roots, Gang Starr, and A Tribe Called Quest. Panacea blend Native Tongues-inspired beats with warm major chords and soul samples and add smart, conscious rhymes about life, love, and of course, hip hop.&quot;\n\n\nWikipedia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:060868ab6f5ac62f67412c78186f9ab3b95e1651","amp;dn":"Panacea+Discography+2004-2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"060868ab6f5ac62f67412c78186f9ab3b95e1651","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,8,104,171,111,90,198,47,103,65,44,120,24,111,154,179,185,94,22,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
