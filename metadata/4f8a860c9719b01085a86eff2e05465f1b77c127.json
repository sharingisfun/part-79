Initially associated with New Wave and the neo-psychedelic sound of the mid 1980s, their music later became more reminiscent of &quot;progressive rock,&quot; featuring long instrumental jams and complex guitar interplay.\n\nThe Church's debut album, Of Skins and Heart (1981), earned them their first radio hit &quot;The Unguarded Moment.&quot; They were signed to major labels in Australia, Europe and the U.S. However, the U.S. label was dissatisfied with their second album and dropped the band without releasing the album. This put a dent in their commercial success, but they made a comeback in 1988, with the album Starfish and the American Top 40 hit &quot;Under the Milky Way.&quot; Subsequent commercial success proved elusive, however, and the band weathered several line-up changes in the 1990s. The last decade has seen them settle on their current lineup, which features the original three founding members plus drummer Tim Powles.\n\n\n\n.ooOO ROSA MANNEN 2010 OOoo.\n                                                                                   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/RosaMannen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/RosaMannen&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f8a860c9719b01085a86eff2e05465f1b77c127","amp;dn":"The+Church+-+You+Took","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f8a860c9719b01085a86eff2e05465f1b77c127","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,138,134,12,151,25,176,16,133,168,110,255,46,5,70,95,27,119,193,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
