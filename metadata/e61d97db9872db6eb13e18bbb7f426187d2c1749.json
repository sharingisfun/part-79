It is a mix of the original re-mastered tracks of AC/DC, played over some awesome parts of the movie... The main reason I made this is because there is so much unreleased AC/DC in the movie, that you can't hear anywhere else, and it sounds really good to a soundtrack.... Very enjoyable for a fan of AC/DC and Maximum Overdrive.\n\n\n\n\nLength: 49:04 \n\nSize: 44.9 mb \n\nBit rate: 128 kbps \n\n\n\n\n01 - Who Made Who? \n02 - Riff 1 \n03 - Curt &amp; Connie \n04 - Brett \n05 - D.T. \n06 - Shred 1 \n07 - Chase The Ace \n08 - D.T.
