We play excerpts, and get commentary from Harvard law professor Charles Ogletree, who has known Kagan for 25 years and serves as special counsel to President Obama.\n\n\n- Harvard Law Professor Charles Ogletree on &quot;The Presumption of Guilt: The Arrest of Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Race, Class and Crime in America&quot;\n\nThe Cambridge Police Department is scheduled to release the results today of an independent review of the arrest of leading African American Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. by a white police officer last year. The incident made national headlines and sparked a national debate on race relations that reached all the way to the White House. Harvard law professor Charles Ogletree acted as counsel to professor Gates throughout the incident, which he documents along with other incidents of racial profiling in his new book, &quot;The Presumption of Guilt: The Arrest of Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Race, Class and Crime in America.&quot;\n\n\n- From Ku Klux Klan Member to Iraq War Opponent and Obama Supporter, Late Sen. Robert Byrd Remembered for &quot;Principle and Honor&quot;\n\nDemocratic Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia will lie in state today following his death at the age of ninety-two. Elected in 1958, Byrd served an unprecedented nine terms in the US Senate. In the 1940s, Byrd was a prominent member of Ku Klux Klan in West Virginia, rising to the position of &quot;exalted cyclops.&quot; He opposed the desegregation of the US military and filibustered the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Byrd would later apologize, saying his association with the Klan was a sad mistake. In 2008, he endorsed President Obama for president. In 2003, he was a leading critic of President BushÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s push to invade Iraq. Charles Ogletree says: &quot;We donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t judge people by how they were born but how they lived their life, and here is a man who in the long-term was a giant and a champion.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce4eebf48b815f4d487ec825456ea15b3b1d8ed2","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+30+jun+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce4eebf48b815f4d487ec825456ea15b3b1d8ed2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,78,235,244,139,129,95,77,72,126,200,37,69,110,161,91,59,29,142,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
