However, the idealism of being on the road wears off and it quickly proves to be a lonely and unfulfilling experience for Davy. One night in a motel room he gets a random phone call from a mysterious woman named Nicole. They start a funny and intimate long distance relationship that leaves Davy happier than he has been in years. Hoping there is more to the relationship then a voice and a phone bill, Davy decides he wants to meet Nicole. Ultimately, he will have to face not only the truth about their relationship but also about himself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a707edbbe6ee751223bf182705e50d571f1378fb","amp;dn":"Easier.With.Practice.2009.DVDRip.XviD-FRAGMENT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a707edbbe6ee751223bf182705e50d571f1378fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,7,237,187,230,238,117,18,35,191,24,39,5,229,13,87,31,19,120,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
