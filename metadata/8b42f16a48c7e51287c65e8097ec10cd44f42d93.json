In reality, though, he's a Walter Mitty-type fantasist. \n\nWaiting to catch a holiday flight to Spain, he meets boring, humourless divorcÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e Brian Bryant (Michael Gambon). A close friendship develops under the Spanish sun. Ralph's lies land both himself and Brian in trouble, such as his riding a mule instead of travelling by tour bus. They come to depend on one another: Ralph needing Brian because he is the only one to take him at face value, and Brian needing Ralph because he is the sort of man he aspires to being. Both are genuinely pathetic.\n\nThanks go to original poster nwab on UUNET &amp; Junker at the box","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b42f16a48c7e51287c65e8097ec10cd44f42d93","amp;dn":"The+Other+One+Series+2+-1979+British+Comedy+%28VHSRIP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b42f16a48c7e51287c65e8097ec10cd44f42d93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,66,241,106,72,199,229,18,135,198,94,128,151,236,16,205,68,244,45,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
