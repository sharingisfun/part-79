It consisted of two seasons: season 1 comprised 7 episodes and season 2 comprised 6 episodes.\n\nBriers is Ralph Tanner, a man who's never encountered a lie that he can't live out to the full. Compulsively economical with the truth, he uses any means, no mater how embarrassing or calamitous to give the impression of being a lone wolf, worldly wise and someone who's been everywhere, seen it all and done it better than anyone else!\n\nReality, of course, is wildly different. For is seems Ralph is grossly inexperienced, wildly incompetent and totally ill-equipped for life. Yet he's convincing enough to impress the gullible, timid Brian (Michael Gambon). When he encounters the brash Ralph at the airport, ready to escape on the same flight to sunny Spanish paradise, Brian hopes they'll go everywhere, see everything and do it all.\n\nMain Castt:\nRichard Briers\nMichael Gambon\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEpisode Information:\n\nEpisode 1\nOriginal Air Date: 11th November 1977\n\nTwo boring bachelors befriend each other on a package holiday.\n\nEpisode 2\nOriginal Air Date: 18th November 1977\n\nRalph shows Brian the delights of improvisation.\n\nEpisode 3\nOriginal Air Date: 25th November 1977\n\nBrian and Ralph plan to go girl hunting.\n\nEpisode 4\nOriginal Air Date: 2nd December 1977\n\nRalph argues with Brian but finds a new friend.\n\nEpisode 5 \nOriginal Air Date: 9th December 1977\n\nWith their holiday nearly over, Ralph and Brian prepare for the realities of their return to Britain.\n\nEpisode 6 \nOriginal Air Date: 16th December 1977\n\nBack in England, Ralph searches for Brian.\n\nEpisode 7 \nOriginal Air Date: 30th December 1977\n\nRalph makes a last-ditch attempt to win over Brian as a permanent friend.\n\nMassive thanks to dirkroberts for the original uploads &amp; JuiCe for the repack at a torrent site elsewhere,","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c7b9ff8be6b4ae6fcc30f7ced10e483a3864916","amp;dn":"The+Other+One+-+Series+1+%281977%29+%5BDVDRip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c7b9ff8be6b4ae6fcc30f7ced10e483a3864916","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,123,159,248,190,107,74,230,252,195,15,124,237,16,228,131,163,134,73,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
