One of the world's leading tiger cameramen, Colin Stafford-Johnson, leads us on a search for the truth about the fate of the late tiger, and his obsession carries us on a journey that exposes what is happening to the home of some of the world's favourite and most iconic animals.\n\nDesignated wildlife corridors and wildlife refuges, although still marked on maps, have mostly disappeared, and Ranthambore National Park is now an isolated oasis in a vast sea of agricultural land. Why did this young tiger leave Ranthambore National Park, supposedly one of India's best protected tiger reserves? How could he possibly have survived in rural India for as long as he did? And what does his story tell us about the fate of the last wild tigers on Earth - an utterly shameful extinction that is happening on our watch?\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 349 MiB for 44mn 21s 672ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : HDTV\nLanguage          : English\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Nature/Science\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 954 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 336 (1.810) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 133 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87664b9097e68605d73a3ab02c6a03efa59dd63d","amp;dn":"CBC+The+Nature+of+Things.S50E4.HDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87664b9097e68605d73a3ab02c6a03efa59dd63d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,102,75,144,151,230,134,5,215,58,58,176,44,106,3,239,165,157,214,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
