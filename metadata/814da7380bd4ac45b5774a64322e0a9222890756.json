The marauding mercenary of English           \n         folklore is one of history's best-known tales, and the        \n         legend of Robin Hood is the inspiration for more movies,      \n         radio and TV programs than any other folk hero. But the       \n         image of a hero in tights and a feathered cap is a somewhat   \n         recent addition to the myth. In reality, Robin Hood is a      \n         composite of several historical figures whose exploits date   \n         back to the age of the Crusades. In the film Robin Hood,      \n         starring Russell Crowe, director Ridley Scott's production    \n         is based on the most solid and recent historical research     \n         into the character and promises a startlingly fresh           \n         interpretation of Robin Hood for a new generation. This       \n         special will distinguish between historical evidence and      \n         Hollywood fiction, and seek to create a realistic portrait    \n         of the mythical hero. Includes clips from the film as well    \n         as interviews with director Scott, principal Robin Hood       \n          cast members and renowned historians.                         \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n         Release  Notes    \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n          Group Greets     \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                           CTU, ORENJi, 2HD, DHD                       \n                                                                        \n            and all other groups that choose quality over speed         \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n        \n       Contact Info      \n                                      \n                                        \n                                                                  \n       We are currently looking for:                                  \n                                                                       \n           * US/CA cappers with HDTV and/or DSR feed - min 60 kB/s      \n                                                                        \n         GROUP NEWS: No, we will not affil your brand new/DR/colo site, \n                     so please don't ask.
