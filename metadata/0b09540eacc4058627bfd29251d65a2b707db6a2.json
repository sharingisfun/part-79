I will not be taking January off, it'll just be\na nice bonus, 100 track torrent. I'm sure my opinion of the best will\ndiffer from other's, but we all have to agree that it's turning out\nto be a great year for music in spite of all the hand-wringing paranoid\nramblings of frightened men in suits.\n\nThanks to p-duke on Flickr for this month's cover.
