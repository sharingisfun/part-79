Walkthroughs are all in high definition (1280x720, avi format) and if you follow them, you'll get it done 100%, means all puzzle pieces and all 8 stars. They are all Dled from Y0uTube so basicaly you can look for them there, but I think it's more convenient to simply DL them in this form.\n\nAbout the game: Its a 1.0 version cracked by Unleashed and is portable - means you dont have to install it. Sadly, the save file is left on the computer you are playing it.\n\nI have also added a story explained file that I DLed from some site. If you care about it, but can't quite understand what's it about, it's all there.\n\nIf you are experiencing any difficulties running the game, make sure you have the latest directX 9 installed (august 2009 version required).\n\n                        --------------------------------\n----------------------&lt;  V E R Y    I M P O R T A N T !  &gt;-------------------------\n                        --------------------------------\n\nIt will be sad to lose such a cool indie developer like the one behind this title, so if you like the game, please buy it - it's really cheap, like 15ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ or I even heard 5 on discount, so that's really nothing and its for your own good. Just think about how many inovative games like this one you have played lately... Big companies with their big titles rarely gives you this...\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                                           ---------------------\nONE MORE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT WALKTHROUGHS - CONSIDER AS   W A R N I N G ! ! !\n                                                           ---------------------\n------------------------------------------------------\nIF YOU WATCH A WALKTHROUGH, YOU CAN NEVER UN-WATCH IT!\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll the puzzles in Braid are reasonable.\n\nThey don't require you to do anything random; they don't require guessing. They don't require trial and error. The solutions tend to be simple and natural. They flow directly from the rules of gameplay in each world.\n\nIf you are having problems solving a puzzle, DON'T GIVE UP!\n\nSome of the puzzles will be hard. But when you manage to solve those hard puzzles, you will feel very good about it. The game will feel very rewarding.\nDON'T ROB YOURSELF OF THAT FEELING BY WATCHING OR READING A WALKTHROUGH!\n\nPLEASE DO NOT USE A WALKTHROUGH.\n\nBraid does not have a linear story the way most games do, so Getting To The End is not necessarily what you would expect. The idea of &quot;beating the game&quot; does not apply so much, here. Braid is about the journey, not the destination. If you use a walkthrough to bypass some of the puzzles, you will be robbing yourself of that journey.\n\nDON'T GIVE UP.\n\nAll the puzzles can be solved. Some of them might take an hour or two, but you will get it. If you try. And you will feel cool and smart. If you read a walkthrough (or get spoilers from a forum),\nYOU CAN NEVER UN-READ IT. YOU CAN NEVER UN-WATCH IT! YOU CAN NEVER UN-SPOILER YOURSELF! So don't spoiler yourself.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTOO MANY PEOPLE ARE ABANDONING TORRENT AFTER DOWNLOADING. PLEASE DO HELP SEED. I \n\nHAVE LEFT EVERYTHING UNZIPPED ON PURPOSE SO IT DOESNT TAKE YOUR EXTRA SPACE. I \n\nHAVE REACHED RATIO OF 50 AND GENERALY AT THAT POINT I LEAVE THE TORRENT IN GODS \n\nHANDS. IF YOU DONT LIKE IT HOWEVER PLEASE COMMENT, RATE, WHATEVER AND I WILL \n\nREMOVE IT.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c13866619a24e6b320be88f982d6bb09fda0ced","amp;dn":"Braid-Unleashed+v.1.0%2BHD.WALKTHROUGHS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c13866619a24e6b320be88f982d6bb09fda0ced","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,19,134,102,25,162,78,107,50,11,232,143,152,45,107,176,159,218,12,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
