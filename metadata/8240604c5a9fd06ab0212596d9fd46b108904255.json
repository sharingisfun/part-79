The title rides along in a heavily stylized font across the bottom while in the foreground an image of a city-steppin' Chill Rob G presides as cool as his name, which hangs above riddled with bullet holes; meanwhile, in the background an op-art pattern dominates to the right of Chill, while cops and street-prestige symbols of cars and women compete on the left. The dichotomy is puzzling but understandable. Chill Rob G is a tough East Coast rapper, but the song he's best known for is an international pop hit, &quot;The Power,&quot; by Snap! Granted Chill was only sampled by the Europop group but, perhaps in an attempt to grab some of the cash, he covers Snap!'s version of &quot;The Power&quot; on Ride the Rhythm. Even though the song would sound perfectly normal on one of Snap!'s albums, here it nearly derails an otherwise solid album. The other songs represent classic early-'90s chopped-funk production, courtesy of Flavor Unit producer the 45 King. The pinnacle of their collaboration is the classic &quot;Let the Words Flow,&quot; which manages to maintain its bulldog stance and be danceable at the same time","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8240604c5a9fd06ab0212596d9fd46b108904255","amp;dn":"Chill+Rob+G+-+Ride+The+Rhythm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8240604c5a9fd06ab0212596d9fd46b108904255","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,64,96,76,90,159,208,106,176,33,37,150,217,253,70,177,8,144,66,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
