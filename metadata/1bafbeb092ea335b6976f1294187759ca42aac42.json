It was written by Jordan B. Gorfinkel (Everything's Relative, Editor of Batman) and pencilled by Jeff Johnson (Wonder Man, Way of the Rat).\n\nThe Jacobian is about a private investigator with no memory of his past, but an uncanny knack of having incredible hunches when under pressure, who is hired by a mysterious woman to find her husband. However, she knows nothing of the man and cannot even prove that he exists, she just knows that she has a husband and that he is missing. \n\n\nReleased on &lt;a href=&quot; http://ComicPirates.info&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://ComicPirates.info&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bafbeb092ea335b6976f1294187759ca42aac42","amp;dn":"The+Jacobian+%28DC+Comics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bafbeb092ea335b6976f1294187759ca42aac42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,175,190,176,146,234,51,91,105,118,241,41,65,135,117,156,164,42,172,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
