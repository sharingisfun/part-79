Gary Gray. The film stars Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Seth Green, Jason Statham, Mos Def, and Donald Sutherland. It is a remake of the 1969 British film of the same name, and is about a team of thieves who plan to steal gold bullion from a former associate who double crossed them. Despite the shared title, the plot and characters of this film differ from those of its source material; Gray described the film as &quot;an homage to the original.&quot;[2]\n\nMost of the film was shot on location in Venice, Italy and Los Angeles, where canals and streets, respectively, were temporarily shut down during principal photography. Produced by Paramount Pictures, The Italian Job was theatrically released in the United States on May 30, 2003, and grossed over $176 million worldwide. Critical response was generally positive, with publications highlighting the action sequences. The prominence of the BMW Mini Cooper automobiles in the film has been seen as a contemporary example of product placement. A sequel has reportedly been in development since 2004, but has yet to be produced as of 2010.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31816e5f2e578a8b6bf43df8abe231e79fe89c87","amp;dn":"The+Italian+Job+2+%5BBluRocket%5D+%5BMP4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31816e5f2e578a8b6bf43df8abe231e79fe89c87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,129,110,95,46,87,138,139,107,244,61,248,171,226,49,231,159,232,156,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
