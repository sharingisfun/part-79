Led by the dedicated and  \n                    tough DSI Martha Lawson, the unit's secret  \n                    weapon is maverick DI John Bloom, whose  \n                    background in undercover work means he knows  \n                    what it is like to pretend to be someone else.  \n                    A man is brought in for shooting a police  \n                    officer but claims that he has been set up by  \n                    an identity thief called 'Smith'. When the team  \n                    uncover similar recent cases, Bloom becomes  \n                    convinced that the thief is punishing his  \n                    victims for cheating on their significant  \n                    others. Can the team use Bloom's insight to  \n                    track down Smith?                        \n                                                         \n                                                                                                \n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n                     \n                        Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:006a358873c23a08207b9bd9b78f89d5800995cc","amp;dn":"Identity.2010.S01E01.HDTV.XviD-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"006a358873c23a08207b9bd9b78f89d5800995cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,106,53,136,115,194,58,8,32,123,155,217,183,143,137,213,128,9,149,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
