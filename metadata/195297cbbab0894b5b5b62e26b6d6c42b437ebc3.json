The situation brings fellow mutants and former friends Erik Lehnsherr, a.k.a. Magneto, and Professor Charles Xavier into opposition. While Xavier seeks to stop the hatred toward mutants peacefully, Magneto seeks to even things out with a machine that would speed up the mutation process in all humans, making everyone equal. To stop Magneto, Xavier brings together a special group of mutants called &quot;X-Men&quot; to stop him. In the meantime, 2 mysterious mutants, one named Logan, a powerful and aggressive mutant with no past, no memories, and a young girl named Rogue emerge. Their quests for identities eventually land them in the sights of Xavier and Magneto, but for what purpose?\n\nScreen Shots.........: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/RS%20Shots/x11.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/RS%20Shots/x11.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/RS%20Shots/x12.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/RS%20Shots/x12.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/RS%20Shots/x13.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/RS%20Shots/x13.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/RS%20Shots/x14.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/RS%20Shots/x14.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/RS%20Shots/x15.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/RS%20Shots/x15.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nX2:  X-Men United (2003)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVideo Resolution.....: 853 x 352 (640x352 Container)\nVideo Bitrate........: 1.36 Mbps\nPoster Art...........: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/RS%20Shots/px-men2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/RS%20Shots/px-men2.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nIMDb Link............: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290334/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290334/&lt;/a&gt;\nIMDb Description.....: After the events on Liberty Island, everyone at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters are settling in.

So these are re-encodes I did a few months back that use the new method developed by HolyRoses which gives you a nice big picture with plenty of pixels, yet still works on the iPods and doesn't eat up a whole bunch of space.  All together, they're still less than 3.4 GB and for the quality you get, that's a steal!  I figured I should upload these since I just recently uploaded my encode of X-Men Origins:  Wolverine.  I'm happy to say that torrent has been highly successful with over one thousand completed downloads in only 72 hours!!  For a movie that's been out and encoded by many others, I'm surprised and delighted to see so many people downloaded it!\n\n\nAnd since I've been adding a bit of trivia to my recent uploads, here's some things that not all of you may know ...\n\n - The sunglasses worn by Cyclopse are Oakley &quot;X-Metals&quot;, an inside joke by the Costume Department.\n\n - The cop that Sabertooth stabs in front of the Statue of Liberty at the end of the first film, is D.B. Sweeney (The Cutting Edge, Memphis Belle, Lonesome Dove) who is a huge fan of the comics and actually tried out for the part of Cylcops.  When he tried out, he told the casting director that even if he didn't get the part, he'd love to be an extra in the film.\n\n - Oddly enough, many fans and interviewers have made fun of the fact that Rebecca Romaijn had to endure 5 hours of make-up before every scene, but in fact, the record for longest make-up session for the Trilogy of films is held by Alan Cumming who had to endure over 10 hours of make-up before filming the Church scene in X2 when he is seen naked from the waist up.\n\n - The fairly small role of Kitty Pryde (the girl who walks through walls) in X-Men:  Last Stand was probably the hardest to fill.  Initially, they wanted and asked Summer Glau (Firefly, Serenity, Terminator:  The Sarah Connor Chronicles) to come in and read for the part, but then they instead hired Maggie Grace (Shannon from &quot;Lost&quot;).  But then they found out that she would appear too old in comparison to her classmates since the little girl made an appearance in one of the earlier films.  So Ellen Page (Juno, Hard Candy) was contacted, but initially she refused the cast call.  Brett Ratner, the director, called her personally and got her to come in and read for the part, she then took it.  Oddly enough, in interviews Diablo Cody (Writer/Director of Juno) recognized her headshot when looking through the day's tryouts for the part of Juno and said to the casting director, &quot;Isn't this the X-Men who can walk through walls?&quot;\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdditional Info\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike all my iPod torrents, these files have their ID3 tags preformatted for your ease!  Album Art, Release Dates, and TV Tags are already filled out for you.  However, if you wish to change them, I recommend the third-party tagging program TVTagger.\n\nAfter downloading, please leave your client open and the torrent actively seeding so others may download as well and your ratio will remain high!  Also remember not to severely limit your upload speed by over-throttling.  Be kind, rewind!  Remember to eat your green vegetables.
