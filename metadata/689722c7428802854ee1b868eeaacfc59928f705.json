It bothered me. Sounds to me like somebody had the TV on during the recording. It's a narrow ringing noise from around 15.25 to 16.2 kilocycles. I took it out. Your ears will thank me, those of you that haven't lost your high-frequency hearing.\n\nAnd for the sake of convenience, the Purple Chick version of &quot;Piggies&quot;, which combined their source with the Anthology version, is here as well. I prefer to listen to it than the Complete Home Recordings version, personally.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:689722c7428802854ee1b868eeaacfc59928f705","amp;dn":"Beatles+-Complete+Home+Recordings+1968+%28Esher-Kinfauns%29+%28de-ring","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"689722c7428802854ee1b868eeaacfc59928f705","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,151,34,199,66,136,2,133,78,225,184,104,238,170,207,197,153,40,247,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
