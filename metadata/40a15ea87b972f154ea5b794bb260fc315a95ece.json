With its addictive action, frantic first person shooter combat,\nmassive arsenal of weaponry, RPG elements and four-player co-op, Borderlands\nis the breakthrough experience that challenges all the conventions of modern\nshooters. Borderlands places you in the role of a mercenary on the lawless\nand desolate planet of Pandora, hell bent on finding a legendary stockpile\nof powerful alien technology known as The Vault.\n\n\nProper Notes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe usual suspects suprised us again.

We are realy frightened what happend with our honored friends\nin Reloaded ... .. and by the way the game exe isnt the same as your\ntry media one.
