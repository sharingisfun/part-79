She is skeptical when a tarot reader, Sunita Rao, predicts that she will go to South Africa and find the love of her life in seven days. She is pleasantly surprised when she is selected to go to a Youth Festival in South Africa.\n\nAmit, who is from Delhi, also goes to South Africa and he is everything Priya does not want in a man. Amit and his friend break into the girlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dorm and while they are being chased by a matron, Amit enters PriyaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s room and is struck by her beauty. He steals her diary and makes a copy of it and replaces it.\n\nKnowing exactly what Priya wants, he pursues her and they fall in love but their happiness is shattered when Priya realizes he has read her diary and lied to her. She breaks up with Amit despite his protests. He tells her it was destiny which brought them together. \n\nPriya decides to test destiny and asks Amit to write his full name on a fifty rupee note and buys a notebook with it. She writes her full name and phone number in the book and gives it to an old book shop. She feels that if destiny really meant for them to be together theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d find the note and the book again and find each other.\n\nThree years later Priya and Amit are engaged to marry different people. \n\nWill the fifty rupee note and the notebook find their way back into Priya and AmitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hands and bring them back together? Or does destiny have other plans for them?\n\n\nCAST:\n\nShahid Kapoor as Amit\nKareena Kapoor as Priya\nDelnaaz Paul as Honey\nSatish Shah as Amit's Father\nKirron Kher as Sunita Rao\nSarfaraz Khan as Ashish\nAarti Chhabria\nHimani Shivpuri\nSatish Kaushik\n\n####################################################################################\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.milengemilenge.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.milengemilenge.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443331/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443331/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.indiafm.com/movies/cast/7301/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.indiafm.com/movies/cast/7301/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n###################################################################################\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nurs,\n\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£           Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£             Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£    \nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£     Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£         Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£    Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£           Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£ Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£   \nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£     Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£         Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£                Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£   Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£  \nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£     Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£          Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£          Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£     Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£ \nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£     Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£               Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£         Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£ \nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£     Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£         Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£    Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£         Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£     Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£ \nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£  Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£  Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£  Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£ Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£     Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c9f4549ce9ebabde2e00239bb0c1ea19760f640","amp;dn":"Milenge+Milenge+%282010%29+CAM+VCD_with_sample_D_S_A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c9f4549ce9ebabde2e00239bb0c1ea19760f640","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,159,69,73,206,158,186,189,226,224,2,57,187,12,30,161,151,96,246,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
