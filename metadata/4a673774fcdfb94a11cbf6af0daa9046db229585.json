Their new next-door neighbors are young newlyweds Steph and Jeff - idealistic, passionate, adorable and married for all of 12 days.\n\nIt's a show about new marriage versus old marriage, about keeping the romance alive - or at least staying together so you have someone to drive you to the hospital for your operations. Eddie is a cynical realist who considers himself an expert on most topics. A high school history teacher, he's learned well the lessons of history and applies the basic principles to his marriage: all fights are about power, land and resources - and women love to kill fun.\n\nwww.tvrage.com\n\nAmerican Comedy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a673774fcdfb94a11cbf6af0daa9046db229585","amp;dn":"Til+Death+Season+1%262+-+dextR123-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a673774fcdfb94a11cbf6af0daa9046db229585","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,103,55,116,252,223,185,74,17,203,246,175,13,170,144,70,219,34,149,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
