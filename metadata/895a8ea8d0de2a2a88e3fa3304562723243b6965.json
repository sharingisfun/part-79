Cant wait for ya to get back in action. :D Continuing the legacy of great quality, KiNGDOM releases... ;) I dont even want to hear it. :lol: Framerate fixed, all is good now. I know it seems like it was 5x, but the first 2 I did were from the XViD which was not great at all. Then the 2 rips from the DVD had a bad frame rate, so here is v2 of the blurred dvdscr. Sample included with motion parts. Sorry bout the previous releases, wont happen again. I was just determined to get it right, as I usually do. TAKE IT or LEAVE IT. ;) \nI am looking for some new sources cams,direct audio,dvd or vhs screeners, exclusive boxes, syncers or any thing else you can provide Contact us @ &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;0a6163646d6e65674a627f7962246b63&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \nGreets: KingBen, tiato, DiNGiE - All of Kingdom &amp; UKB, STG, IMAGiNE, The GRiM, KK, paulx1, Secret Myth, Ho's, and all else I Respect, you know who yall are ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:895a8ea8d0de2a2a88e3fa3304562723243b6965","amp;dn":"Grown+Ups+2010+DVDSCR+BLURRED+v2+XViD-KiNGDOM+%28Kingdom-Release%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"895a8ea8d0de2a2a88e3fa3304562723243b6965","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,90,142,168,208,222,42,42,136,227,250,51,4,86,39,35,36,59,105,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
