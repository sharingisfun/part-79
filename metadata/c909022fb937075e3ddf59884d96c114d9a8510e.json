It is one of the most influential works of philosophy and political theory, and arguably Plato's best known work. In it, Socrates and various other Athenians and foreigners discuss the meaning of justice and whether the just man is happier than the unjust man by constructing an imaginary city ruled by philosopher-kings. The dialogue also discusses the nature of the philosopher, Plato's Theory of Forms, the conflict between philosophy and poetry, and the immortality of the soul. (Summary from Wikipedia)\n\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOur intention is, that Timaeus, who is the most of an astronomer amongst us, and has made the nature of the universe his special study, should speak first, beginning with the generation of the world and going down to the creation of manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Timaeus' is usually regarded as one of Plato's later dialogues, and provides an account of the creation of the universe, with physical, metaphysical and ethical dimensions, which had great influence over philosophers for centuries following. It attributes the order and beauty of the universe to a benevolent demiurge ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“craftsman' or god ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ fashioning the physical world after the pattern of an ideal, eternal one.\n\nThe dramatic setting of the dialogue is the day after a discussion in which Socrates has described his ideal state ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ as in the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Republic'. A conversation between Socrates, Critias, Hermocrates and Timaeus, including Critias' account of Solon's journey to Egypt (where he hears the story of Atlantis), soon gives way to the monologue by Timaeus that forms the bulk of the work.\n\n'Timaeus' is translated by Benjamin Jowett and his comprehensive introduction to and analysis of the work precedes the text itself, which he describes as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe growth of an age in which philosophy is not wholly separated from poetry and mythologyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\n(Summary by Philippa)\n\n\n\nAwaiting his trial on charges of impiety and heresy, Socrates encounters Euthyphro, a self-proclaimed authority on matters of piety and the will of the gods. Socrates, desiring instruction in these matters, converses with Euthyphro, but as usual, the man who professes to know nothing fares better than the man who claims to be an expert. One of Plato's well-known Socratic Dialogues, Euthyphro probes the nature of piety, and notably poses the so-called Euthyphro Dilemma: Do the gods love a thing because it is holy, or is a thing holy because it is loved by the gods? (Summary by LauraFox)\nQuote:\nPlato's account of Socrates' defense at his trial for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcorrupting the youthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a classic summation of his teacher's life and mission, centered in Socrates' most famous line, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe unexamined life is not worth living.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (Summary by FrZeile)\n\n\nThe Symposium (Ancient Greek: ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â£Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â¼Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã…â€™Ãƒï¿½Ã†â€™ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â¹ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â¿ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â½) is a philosophical book written by Plato sometime after 385 BCE. On one level the book deals with the genealogy, nature and purpose of love, on another level the book deals with the topic of knowledge, specifically how does one know what one knows. The topic of love is taken up in the form of a group of speeches, given by a group of men at a symposium or a wine drinking party at the house of the tragedian Agathon at Athens. Plato constructed the Symposium as a story within a story within a story. This architecture creates the space for Plato to build his philosophy of knowledge. The speech of Socrates points out that the highest purpose of Love is to become a Philosopher, or Lover of Wisdom. (Summary from Wikipedia)\n\n\nIn Plato's Ion, Socrates questions Ion on whether he should really claim laud and glory for his 'rhapsodic' recitals of Homer's poetry.

These files can have chapter markers which can be skipped through as you would skip through files on a play list. They can have built in cover art and chapter images. They will remember where you left off each time you stop the file and come back to it . And variable speed settings on Ipods and a growing number of other mp3 players can be utilized by this file type. The ability to bookmark allows for as little as one large file instead of many small ones without the burden of fast forwarding to find your spot every time you resume listening or the fear of otherwise losing your place. The reduced number of files also makes browsing through your files to find your book and your place in it much less effort.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c909022fb937075e3ddf59884d96c114d9a8510e","amp;dn":"Librivox+M4B+Audiobook+-+Republic%2C+Timaeus%2C+Euthyphro%2C+Apology%2C+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c909022fb937075e3ddf59884d96c114d9a8510e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,9,2,47,185,55,7,94,61,223,89,136,77,150,193,20,217,168,81,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
