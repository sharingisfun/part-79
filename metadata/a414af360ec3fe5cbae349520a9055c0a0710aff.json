Chicago, IL, June, 1973, Enja ENJ 6028-66\nYear: 1973 \nLabel: Enja \nAudio CD: September 15, 1998 \nLabel: Enja Records \nQuality: Flac \n\nHampton Hawes went through a period of inconsistency during the early '70s with his ill-advised addition of electric keyboards, but this is happily an all-acoustic live set from the Jazz Showcase in Chicago.  Joined by a formidable rhythm section consisting of bassist Cecil McBee and drummer Roy Haynes, Hawes launches this second volume with an extended medley of a driving hard bop rendition of Charlie Parker's blues &quot;Bluebird&quot; and his own &quot;Blue Hamp,&quot; never running out of ideas even though this track is over 26 minutes long.  His interpretation of &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot; is initially hesitant, but packs an emotional punch as it develops.  It's a shame he didn't extend his rather abbreviated performance of the lively &quot;Carson Blues,&quot; which was evidently intended as a set closer.  The only misfire of the date is his &quot;Walking Around the Town,&quot; an original featuring Hawes' rather awkward vocals. ~ Ken Dryden, All Music Guide \n\nPersonnel:\nHampton Hawes (p)\nCecil McBee (b)\nRoy Haynes (d):\n\nLive At The Jazz Showcase In Chicago Tracks:\n01  MC By Joe Segal\n02  Blue Bird / Blue Vamp\n03  My Funny Valentine\n04  MC By Hampton Hawes\n05  Walking Around The Town\n06  The Shadow Of Your Smile\n07  Carson Blues\n08  Spanish Mood","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a414af360ec3fe5cbae349520a9055c0a0710aff","amp;dn":"Hampton+Hawes+-+The+Jazz+Showcase+-+Chicago%2C+V2+%281973%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bfl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a414af360ec3fe5cbae349520a9055c0a0710aff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,20,175,54,14,195,254,92,186,227,73,82,10,144,85,192,160,113,10,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
