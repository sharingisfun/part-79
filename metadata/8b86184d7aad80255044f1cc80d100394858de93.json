How do we manage to block out intense pain? How does our sense of balance keep working under the most extreme conditions? Live action combined with special effects creates incredible imagery to convey the 'feeling' of how our senses work. As an alarm bell goes off, we 'see' the noise, slowed down thousands of times. Ripples of sound roll towards us; we spin around and follow a sound wave as it travels into the dark outer ear canal.\n\nProgramme 2 - Hearing and Balance\n \nSound can have a very powerful effect on how we feel about the world and Nigel Marven is on a quest to track down the sounds which have the most powerful emotional effects on us.Balance is our true sixth sense - it enables us to sense how our bodies are moving around in the world and keep us upright. There are only two kinds of animal that spend their whole lives performing the tricky balancing act of walking on two legs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ humans and some flightless birds, like ostriches.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 50mn 0s 700ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 166 Kbps\nAspect            : 528 x 384 (1.375) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 122 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b86184d7aad80255044f1cc80d100394858de93","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Human+Senses+2+of+3+%282004%29+%5BPDTV%5D%7EEkolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b86184d7aad80255044f1cc80d100394858de93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,134,24,77,122,173,128,37,80,68,241,204,128,209,0,57,72,88,222,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
