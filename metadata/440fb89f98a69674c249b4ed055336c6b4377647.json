If there's one lively Latin-flavored guitar jazz disc by an all-star center fielder you must listen to this year, make it this one.  Don't do it however, just for the novelty of a .300 career-hitting New York Yankee legend making music for a hometown-based label, but because his hobby comes loaded with great melodic ideas and some buoyant, snappy playing.  No doubt many critics will see this as a sports celebrity vanity project, and much will be made of all the top musicians who jumped into the fray (BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©la Fleck, David Sancious, T-Bone Wolk, Luis Conte), but Williams truly holds his own.  The opening track, &quot;La Salsa en Mi,&quot; is feisty Latin jamming with an instantly catchy melody, and sets a lofty standard that some of the mellower tracks simply can't match.  High-spirited exotic sessions like that and the percussion-intense &quot;Desvelado&quot; run rings around more conventional but still engaging light funk-jazz tracks like &quot;The Way&quot; and the lush ballad &quot;Just Because,&quot; whose contribution by labelmate pianist David Benoit is surprisingly subtle.  Those who like simple fingerstyling may most enjoy the interlude &quot;Samba Novo,&quot; while pop fans may best enjoy the mainstream readings of &quot;Dust in the Wind&quot; and Billy Joel's plaintive &quot;And So It Goes.&quot; The best evidence that Williams can funk out as well as he can do salsa ( remember, he's a native Puerto Rican ) is the turbocharged fusion jam &quot;Stranded on the Bridge.&quot;  In contemporary jazz circles, Wayman Tisdale has made a successful move from basketball to bass.  When Bernie Williams retires, more discs like this will ensure that he's more than a one-shot deal.  ~ Jonathan Widran, AMG\n\nWhile attending my very first Yankees game, which also happened to be my first live baseball game ever, I was told that one of the team - Bernie - was an excellent guitar player and composer.  I was intrigued to hear his music, so when I heard this CD I was blown away by his talent.
