In version 10 they have once \n again added a wealth of new features and modules, but the program is still amazingly intuitive \n to use Ã¢â‚¬â€œ everything is explained as you do it. \n\n The main focus of this premium version is even better authoring capabilities for building video \n and audio discs using the latest formats.
