Some epic features (heightened prosaic style, songs to the hero) add to the standard typology of hero defeating villain. It has often been anthologised and has also been published more than once as a short book in its own right. The story was also adapted into an animated TV special by American animator Chuck Jones in 1975. That same year was when the story was adapted into a Russian animated short film.\n\n(From poster)\nThis torrent feel off the tracker due to inactivity, but I'd like to restore it once more.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf5f83f136b901822be5ce31746ecbe2a9d73f1b","amp;dn":"Rikki+Tikki+Tavi+%28childhood+classic%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf5f83f136b901822be5ce31746ecbe2a9d73f1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,95,131,241,54,185,1,130,43,229,206,49,116,110,203,226,169,215,63,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
