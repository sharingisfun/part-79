So here's the same deal this time with Acrobat 9.0 offered by the Adobe Download Center and ChatChitto's awesome patch.\n\nThis torrent is a small DVD that explain and help you download Adobe Acrobat Pro or Extended and how to activate it.\n\nIt's quite basic, but it's awesome !\n\n\n\nThere's a french and an english version. I tried to explain as best as I could the steps but if there's any question feel free to ask.\nWhen you mount the image, a small .bat launches the english instructions. Then you just need to read and watch the pretty pictures.\n\nDon't ask about the .iso format, it worked for my previous mod, I'll stick with it. Use MagicISO (or other) to mount the image :) or you can burn it onto a disc so you can keep it... I don't know do whatever you like, but share it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f71058d8848887ae8fae4c793d4a616c03e44e68","amp;dn":"%5BRNL%5D+Adobe+Acrobat+9.0+EasyMod","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f71058d8848887ae8fae4c793d4a616c03e44e68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,16,88,216,132,136,135,174,143,174,76,121,61,74,97,108,3,228,78,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
