NEWS) was born in the ominous year of 1984, the same year set out in Orwells masterpiece and the year of New Zealands neoliberal economic reforms. After working in the telecommunications industry he quit when he noticed that when he lied to the customer the companies profit margins went up. Unable to work or have an employer in the conventional sense Vincent went out with frustration at the mainstream media and began to make his own news by interviewing the activists about real issues that truly affect New Zealand and the world. The idea is to get the activists who live and breathe the issues and are not bound by corporate or political parties to be the pundits reporters and watch dogs on the multi-faceted agendas of the global elite right here at home. He hopes to one day be part of an alternative media revolution that will replace the mainstream media, for they are no longer relevant.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5028e815f5b52a1fdbc0b55f85588015d08262e7","amp;dn":"Vinny+Eastwood+2010-06-29+Tue+32k-CF+gedude","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5028e815f5b52a1fdbc0b55f85588015d08262e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,40,232,21,245,181,42,31,219,192,181,95,133,88,128,21,208,130,98,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
