Thanks to Yoshihiro and his EBOOT patcher, we now have a working copy of Disgaea 2: Dark Hero Days for the PSP. \n\nPlaying right now, using GEN CFW 5.50 B2. I guess that it should work with all 5.XX CFW, but I haven't tried yet.\n\nWhat are you waiting for, give it a go! No more worrying about $ony's bullshit firmware updates breaking our games!\n\nUpdate: After looking more into it, I guess the patcher allows all custom firmware to play these 5.55 and 6.00 games. So, have fun. It's all open again now!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c6917f532f76b1e557a937e5d844e918a357bdf","amp;dn":"Disgaea+2%3A+Dark+Hero+Days+%28Patched+works+with+all+CFW%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c6917f532f76b1e557a937e5d844e918a357bdf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,105,23,245,50,247,107,30,85,122,147,126,93,132,78,145,138,53,123,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
