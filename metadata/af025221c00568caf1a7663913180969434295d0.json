He was looking for Ambassador Spock, who is a child on Vulcan at that time, disdained by his neighbors for his half-human nature. Twenty years later, Kirk has grown into a young troublemaker inspired by Capt. Christopher Pike to fulfill his potential in Starfleet even as he annoys his instructors like young Lt. Spock. Suddenly, there is an emergency at Vulcan and the newly commissioned USS Enterprise is crewed with promising cadets like Nyota Uhura, Hikura Sulu, Pavel Chekov and even Kirk himself thanks to Leonard McCoyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s medical trickery. Together, this crew will have an adventure in the final frontier where the old legend is altered forever even as the new version of it is just beginning.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://moviefox.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://moviefox.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af025221c00568caf1a7663913180969434295d0","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+SCREENER+XviD-ROAR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af025221c00568caf1a7663913180969434295d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,2,82,33,192,5,104,202,241,167,102,57,19,24,9,105,67,66,149,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
