In 2004, longtime friends Greg Lyons and Josh Ostrander began writing songs that would become their EP, The Southampton Collection. Joined by Vern Zaborowski, their unabashed shows in NYC and Philly did not go unnoticed. Blender wrote it was &quot;refreshing to see a band who actually looked like they enjoyed playing their songs.&quot; Suretone's Jordan Schur heard the EP and signed the band on the spot. Brit-pop super-producer Owen Morris (Oasis, The Verve) crossed the pond to work with the trio. The resulting labor of love is Ameritown. Simple piano and marching-band drum rudiments exist next to distorted barre chords. Ostrander's distinct voice and original melodies create hooks that soar to anthem-like proportions on &quot;Single Sedative&quot; and the crowd-rousing &quot;Yuppy Hipster.&quot; Spin.com called Zaborowski's bass dynamism and Lyons' driving beats &quot;spot on.&quot; Songs range from the lilting &quot;The Box&quot; and &quot;Some Sorta Light,&quot; to the passionate musical assaults of &quot;Noah&quot; and &quot;Nice Clean Shirt.&quot; The secret weapon seems to be Ostrander's lyrics, which seamlessly flip from compassion to completely heartless.&quot; http://www.amazon.com/Ameritown-Eastern-Conference-Champions/dp/B000RS0IK2\n\nEastern Conference Champions - &quot;Ameritown&quot; Genre: Indie/Rock\n\n\n   1.
