For Gabriel, who'd been putting his music in theatrical contexts ever since his days with Genesis, the modern sound of So (coproduced with Daniel Lanois) was a dramatic conceit that effectively played off the organic roots of many of its songs. The album's big hit was &quot;Sledgehammer,&quot; the English rocker's somewhat stilted take on the Stax/Volt style of rhythm &amp; blues. Gabriel is much more powerful on his own art-rock songs, such as &quot;Red Rain,&quot; which evokes nuclear ruin with its cascading rush of guitars and synthesizers. &quot;Don't Give Up&quot; is perhaps Gabriel's best ballad, with Kate Bush's heavenly second vocal enough to give anybody encouragement. But the song that best exploits So's blend of technology and soul is &quot;In Your Eyes,&quot; a beguiling rhythmic tapestry in which Gabriel duets with Youssou N'Dour.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Red Rain\n[02] Sledgehammer\n[03] Don't Give Up \t\t\t- Featuring Kate Bush\n[04] That Voice Again\n[05] In Your Eyes\t\t\t\t- Featuring Youssou N'Dour\n[06] Mercy Street\n[07] Big Time\n[08] We Do What We're Told (Milgram's 37)\n[09] This Is The Picture (Excellent Birds)\n \n\n\n\n\nMp3 Play Time     - 00h:46m:19s\n\nTotal File Size \t- 110mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size  \t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type \t- I-Tunes v8.0.2.20 MP3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format\t- N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t- Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t- Pop Rock\n\nRelease Date\t- 19 May 1986\n\nRecord Company\t- Virgin Records\n\nArtist Website\t- http://petergabriel.com \n\t\t-\n\t\t-\n\t\t- http://www.ilike.com/artist/Peter+Gabriel \n\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e69553165c46ef858c286a3e7b4491177ceb501f","amp;dn":"%5B1986%5D+So+-+Perer+Gabriel+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e69553165c46ef858c286a3e7b4491177ceb501f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,149,83,22,92,70,239,133,140,40,106,62,123,68,145,23,124,235,80,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
