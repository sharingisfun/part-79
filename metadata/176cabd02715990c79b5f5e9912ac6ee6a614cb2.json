The first truly modern war, it changed how warÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and peaceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½would be conducted throughout the remainder of the twentieth century and even to the present.\n\nThe Great War was a time of &quot;firsts&quot; and opened the door to the modern era. Almost all the major developed countries had a role to play in this war, as they never had before. This was the first time for fighting on land, at sea, and in the air. Modern weapons and munitions were developed in previously unimaginable quantities. By the end of the war, international politics, the relationships between the individual and the state, gender relations, and the role of artists and the media were all drastically changed. World War I laid the foundation for the modern world.\n\nThis course examines the major events of the war to further understand how they led to the shaping of this new world.\n\nCourse Syllabus\n\nLecture 1 The Greatest War\n\nLecture 2 Opening Shots\n\nLecture 3 Gallipoli and the Near and Middle East\n\nLecture 4 1915 in the West\n\nLecture 5 Home Fronts\n\nLecture 6 The Western Front in 1916\n\nLecture 7 The Eastern Front\n\nLecture 8 A Literary and Artistic War\n\nLecture 9 1917 in the West\n\nLecture 10 The War at Sea\n\nLecture 11 America Goes to War\n\nLecture 12 Germany Almost Wins the War in 1918\n\nLecture 13 Victory in the West\n\nLecture 14 Aftermath and Reputation\n\nProfessor Ramsden was educated at Oxford University and has taught at Queen Mary University of London since 1972.
