The operation began at 2pm ET. Watch it here, here  or here.\n\nOutrage of a different stripe is in order when it comes to the cozy relationship between government regulators and Big Oil.  From porn, meth and job interviews, to the 500 million dollar grant given to the current Energy SecretaryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s former lab.\n\nAnd let the outrage continueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nBPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s chairman to US critics: remember, we are ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbig and importantÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Watch BPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s CEO barking orders at a cameraman.\n\nAs a savvy caller pointed out a few days ago, BP has a very real financial interest in low-balling the amount spilled, as they could be fined up to $4,300 per barrel. Hiding the evidence of how big the spill may also be one of the driving forces behind BPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s use of hundreds of thousands of gallons of toxic dispersant.  That same dispersant is creating a toxic soup underwater, breaking the oil into droplets capable of passing into the flesh of fish and birds (video below).\n\nAn internal BP memo shows a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ3 Little PigsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ cost/benefit analysis used to save cash at the expense of worker safety. And like Greg Palast told us weeks ago, BP was unprepared for the Exxon Valdez spill (which was their responsibility) just as they were unprepared in the Gulf.\n\nAnd on the immigration front, the perils of racial profiling: an American citizen with his ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpapersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is detained for three days and only set free after a congressman intervened. Obama will be sending 1,200 National Guard troops to the Mexican border to deal with MexicoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sham of a drug war; John McCain wants more, of course. And as usual, a new poll shows America divided down racial lines.\n\nThese stories, your calls, and much more on todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Randi Rhodes Show!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29503e9207f0c18cd8421d5bdd57be889eecd213","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+May+26+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29503e9207f0c18cd8421d5bdd57be889eecd213","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,80,62,146,7,240,193,140,216,66,29,91,221,87,190,136,158,236,210,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
