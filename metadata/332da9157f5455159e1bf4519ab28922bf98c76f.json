Among his recent projects, he announced that nothing was found underneath the Sphinx in drillings. A current effort involves a radar search for the tomb of Cleopatra and Mark Antony, believed to be near Alexandria. He is also excavating for the tombs of Ramses VIII and Nefertiti in the Valley of the Kings, and preparing to make revelations about King Tut's family. \n\nHawass disputed a number of theories about the Sphinx and the pyramids. The Sphinx is no older than 4,500 years, and the construction of the pyramids at Giza is not a mystery, he declared. Except for the casing, the pyramids were built from stones, quarried 600 ft. from the site. He believes that 70% of Egypt's monuments are still buried in the sand, and noted that some 200 foreign expeditions are currently in his country revealing the &quot;secrets in the sand.&quot; \n \n---\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:332da9157f5455159e1bf4519ab28922bf98c76f","amp;dn":"Coast+To+Coast+Am+-+11-24-2008+-+Mysteries%2C+Conspiracies%2C+%26+Anci","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"332da9157f5455159e1bf4519ab28922bf98c76f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,45,169,21,127,84,85,21,158,27,244,81,154,178,137,34,191,152,199,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
