'This is It' is the band's fourth independently released album. The album was mixed at AM Studios in Chennai by Grammy Award winning music producer Jeff Peters. \n\nUnlike many Indian rock acts struggling for the big break, TAAQ has consistently delivered original music with uncanny ease and speed. While the fourth album was out playing on their website; the band had already declared that were ready to roll out albums 5 and 6 subsequently. The most remarkable aspect of TAAQ remains to be their cohesive attitude and approach towards music; although its rock and roll to its core, TAAQ maintains a signature sound on all their albums without exploring ethnic Indian sounds. While their music has just got better ever since they started, 'This is It' brings to the table yet another set of groovy, catchy hooks, sing along choruses and simple yet poignant lyrics which largely talk about everyday life.\n\n\n\n1.
