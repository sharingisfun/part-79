This powerful optimization suite will boost Internet connections, tweak Windows to its peak performance, clean registry and block annoying ads. It's a great way to keep your computer clean and optimized.\n\nSpeed Up PC With BoostSpeed\nModify Windows settings, file system and services to greatly increase system performance. Increase startup and shutdown speed, disable annoying CD autorun and error reporting features. BoostSpeed will keep monitoring your system for possible optimizations and let you know if such optimizations are possible. You can also run the System Optimization Wizard to periodically optimize your PC.\n\nSpeed Up Internet\nAdjust your PC for faster images, music and software downloads, increased browsing speed and reliable Internet connections.

You can add your own web sites to the black list to block them from showing their advertisements.\n\nKeep Disk and Registry Clean\nGet rid of junk on the disks and registry of your PC. Remove hazardous and space-wasting files left by untidy programs and crashes of your system. Dramatically increase the performance of your PC by cleaning, optimizing and defragmenting local disks and registry.\n\nOptimize Memory and Appearance\nBadly written applications constantly steal memory without giving it back. That's why your PC becomes unstable with time and you have to reboot. BoostSpeed automatically frees up computer memory to gain additional performance boost. You can also manually recover memory and clipboard.\n\nKeep your PC fast and safe\nBoostSpeed will detect most of the popular &quot;PC-slowers&quot; - bundle-software (such as eDonkey or Kazaa) which silently download malware and spyware to your computer, taking up internet traffic and slowing down the system. This will also keep your system safe from prying eyes of spyware programs.\n\nBoost Software Products\nBoostSpeed can improve performance of different software products, including Microsoft Office, Internet browsers (such as Internet Explorer, Opera, Mozzila), E-mail clients (Outlook, The Bat), MSN Messenger, ICQ, Media Player and others.\n\nSystem Optimization Tools\nGreatly increase your PC startup speed with Autorun Manager, where you can disable or remove the programs which try to load up when Windows starts up. Force-uninstall unwanted software products which take up space on your computer and slow it down.\n\nNetworks Tools\nKeep your connection alive while you're away, synchronize your computer clock with atomic clock over the Internet, lookup domain names and IP addresses, measure your Internet connection speed. Troubleshoot and improve your Internet connection and local network with an excellent selection of network management tools.\n\n\n\nWindows 2000, XP,2003,Vista,2008,7\nHomepage: http://www.auslogics.com/\n\n\nInstall, Use keygen to register","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce2984c8504bfe0d0d78ebc8b2757582cc26737e","amp;dn":"Auslogics+BoostSpeed+v4.5.14.265","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce2984c8504bfe0d0d78ebc8b2757582cc26737e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,41,132,200,80,75,254,13,13,120,235,200,178,117,117,130,204,38,115,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
