We experience problems and setbacks every day. But during the hardest parts of life, when the bottom seems to fall out, where do we turn for peace?\n\nAlthough God doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t offer any easy solutions, He does offer Himself and His cross as an anchor of hope no matter what we face in life. And more than simply enduring suffering, the hope we find in Him allows us to leverage our darkest moments for His fame. When life hurts most, the world listens most intently to our message, allowing us to broadcast through our pain the goodness of the One who loves us the most.\n\nPart 1: The Anchor Of Hope\nPart 2: The Megaphone Of Hope\n\nApproximate Running Time: 95 Minutes 4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01540d51777e528d630e1cbbd295815b6fa51f20","amp;dn":"Louie+Giglio+-+Hope++dvd-rip+%28DIVX%29+-chapster-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01540d51777e528d630e1cbbd295815b6fa51f20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,84,13,81,119,126,82,141,99,14,28,187,210,149,129,91,111,165,31,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
