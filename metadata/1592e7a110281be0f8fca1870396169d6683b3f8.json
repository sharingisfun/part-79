It was soon clear that the path of the band would be in the heritage of the heavy rock acts of the 70..s with additional layers of a more modern sound.\nThe band has recorded three demos and the band's capacity as a live act has placed them on various stages and venues.\nThe sound of three heavy yet melodic guitars combined with strong vocals and a solid rhythm section has formed the uniqueness of CORRODED.\n\n2008 started out with two very successful gigs as support act to Hardrock Grammy Award Winners Mustasch with stunning live reviews. Numerous great reviews of the demo &quot;III&quot; was published in magazines and newspapers, amongst others a review in Sweden Rock Magazine 50 stands out with this being the number one hardrock/metal magazine in Sweden. Four months into the 2008 the band was booked for Sweden Rock Festival, where they played with some of the best and the biggest in the business. By the fall of 2008 came the departure of two original-members that decided to leave the band. Enter drummer Per SolÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ng and bass-player Bjarne ElvsgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rd.\nThe new line-up consisting of Jens, Peter, Fredrik, Per and Bjarne started with a tour in the U.K. and a record deal with Ninetone Records.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1592e7a110281be0f8fca1870396169d6683b3f8","amp;dn":"Corroded+-+Eleven+Shades+Of+Black+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1592e7a110281be0f8fca1870396169d6683b3f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,146,231,161,16,40,27,224,248,252,161,135,3,150,22,157,102,131,179,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
