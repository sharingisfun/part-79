For those of you who don't know, the Triplets are back on the air again! On last Friday's podcast, Frank announced that starting today Frosty, Heidi, and Frank would be back on the air over on 790 KABC in Los Angeles. I took the opportunity to record the show as it was airing and am now releasing it for you all to enjoy. Despite the fact that it is aired over AM, it actually sounds just as good as their podcasts do.\n\nThe file has been edited using Soundbooth to remove all the commercials, traffic updates, world news, etc. Pretty much everything that isn't them has been removed. I'll be doing this every day, as long as people seed.\n\nDetails:\n\nDate Recorded - October 5, 2009\nFile Format - MP3\nBit Rate - 128 kbps\nSample Rate - 44.100 kHz\nFile Size - 91.5 MB\nLength - 100 Minutes, 13 Seconds\n\nEnjoy, and please...seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20ef488eb007a691467836d8bbfe707385bdc336","amp;dn":"The+Frosty%2C+Heidi%2C+and+Frank+Show+-+October+05%2C+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20ef488eb007a691467836d8bbfe707385bdc336","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,239,72,142,176,7,166,145,70,120,54,216,187,254,112,115,133,189,195,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
