It's the typical Fitz show with many\n      topics.\n\n      G4's Chris Hardwick stops by whom you may know from his most recent\n      project, &quot;Web Soup&quot;.  He is also a part of &quot;Attack Of The Show&quot; which\n      both air on the G4 network.  Chris also is a stand up comedian and has\n      many stories from his life.\n  \n\n   Lineage: Sirius Connect &gt; ProTools &gt; mp3DirectCut &gt; 64kbps 22KHz .mp3\n                       Edited For The True Stern Fan.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:713b9b795426dbefeabad6056fefa0f8c88de0b7","amp;dn":"Howard+Stern+-+Greg+Fitzsimmons+64k+09-01-2009-cf%28wush%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"713b9b795426dbefeabad6056fefa0f8c88de0b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,59,155,121,84,38,219,239,234,186,214,5,111,239,160,248,200,141,224,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
