Please give back as much as you take.\n\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½18 April 2008\nGil Newhall confesses to raping Jennifer Wallace with his friend Kevin Spencer whilst she was drugged fifteen years previously when he was 18. Liz approaches AAG Peter Upton in order to reach a settlement and agree on a prison sentence of three years served even though Kevin Spencer didn't serve time due to a deal. That is until Jennifer, via over-zealous talk radio host Gabriel Waggett, reads a victim impact statement at the sentencing stating that she doesn't agree to the sentencing. The judge agrees with her and they go to court. Elsewhere, Chester prosecutes real estate mogul Victor Robb for the disfigurement of a young girl which occurred in one of his properties. Meanwhile, Molly passes the bar second-time around.\n\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0956036/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d993a1634d3287744e5d34f5be2d30423a5e60c8","amp;dn":"Canterburys+Law+S01E06+-+Sick+As+Your+Secrets.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d993a1634d3287744e5d34f5be2d30423a5e60c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,147,161,99,77,50,135,116,78,93,52,245,190,45,48,66,58,94,96,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
