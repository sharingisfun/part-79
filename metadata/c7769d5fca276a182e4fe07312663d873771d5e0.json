A sequel to the 2008 film Ip Man, the film was directed by Wilson Yip, and stars Donnie Yen, who reprises the leading role. Continuing after the events of the earlier film, the sequel centers on Ip's movements in Hong Kong, which is under British colonial rule. He attempts to propagate his discipline of Wing Chun, but faces rivalry from other practitioners, including the local master of Hung Ga martial arts.\n\nProducer Raymond Wong first announced a sequel before Ip Man's theatrical release in December 2008. Ip Man 2 was intended to focus on the relationship between Ip and his most famed disciple, Bruce Lee. The filmmakers, however, were unable to finalize film rights with Lee's descendants and decided to briefly portray Lee as a child. Principal photography for Ip Man 2 began in August 2009 and concluded in November; filming took place inside a studio located in Shanghai. For the sequel, Yip aimed to create a more dramatic martial arts film in terms of story and characterization; Wong's son, screenwriter Edmond Wong, wanted the film to portray how Chinese people were treated by the British, as well as the Western perceptions towards Chinese martial arts.\n\nIp Man 2 premiered in Beijing on 21 April 2010; the film was released in Hong Kong on 29 April 2010. The film was met with positive reviews; critics praised the film's storytelling, and Sammo Hung's martial arts choreography, but ultimately agreed that the sequel was not as good as its predecessor. To date, Ip Man 2 has grossed over HK$43 million domestically, bringing in more than the entire theatrical gross of its predecessor.\n\nGenre: Action | Biography | History \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProvided By Grizz, Member Of The Ps3 Team\n\n\n\nThis File Will Play On The Following\n\nPC---&gt; VLC Media Player, or Media Player Classic with CCCP Codec Pack\nMAC---&gt; Using roxio toast video player 3.0\nXBOX---&gt; Releases work if you're running windows 7 and streaming on the network through windows media center.\n\nSpecifications\n\nCodec -----------&gt; H.264\nResolution -----&gt; 1920x1080\nBitrate -----------&gt; 4.4Mbps\nFramerate ------&gt; 23.9fps\nAudio ------------&gt; AC3 Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround(640kbs)\nLanguage ----&gt; Cantonese\nSubtitles --------&gt; Hardcoded English\nExtension -------&gt; M2TS\n\n\nProcedure and Testing\n\nHi quality 2-pass H.264 (PS3-Team optimized encoding).\nTested On Sony PS3 Firmware 3.30\nTested On A Vizio 42&quot; LCD, HDTV.\nFile Kept At 4097MB For Easy Storage.(FAT32)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7769d5fca276a182e4fe07312663d873771d5e0","amp;dn":"%E2%80%ACIP+MAN+2+%28Cantonese%29.1080p.AC3%28DD%29.5.1ch.Blu-ray.PS3-TEAM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7769d5fca276a182e4fe07312663d873771d5e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,118,157,95,202,39,106,24,46,79,224,115,18,102,61,135,55,113,213,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
