You  choose  how  and\nwhen to use your arsenal of powerups for  ultimate  impact\nin a race where the outcome is never certain. In Blur  the\nstoryline plays out in the single  player  campaign.  Here\nplayers assume the role of an up-and-coming racer  who  is\nlooking to make a name  for  himself  in  the  underground\nracing scene, but the competition is fierce. As  you  take\non the series of races, you'll meet a bunch  of  recurring\ncharacters. Some  of  these  characters  will  be  rivals,\nothers perhaps will  act  as  mentors,  and  some  may  be\nsomething else entirely. The only thing that is certain in\nthe world of Blur is that in a race there are winners  and\nlosers, and racers will do anything to  reach  the  finish\nline first.\n\nINSTALL NOTES\n\nUnpack\nBurn or mount\nInstall\nCopy the crack from ViTALiTY folder\nDie like the rest\n\nascii\nx/titan\n\n\nOperating System : Microsoft Windows XP / Windows Vista / Windows 7\nProcessor : Intel Pentium D at 3.4 Ghz or equivalent AMD\nVideo Card : 256 MB VRAM ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ with Shader Model 3.0 support.
