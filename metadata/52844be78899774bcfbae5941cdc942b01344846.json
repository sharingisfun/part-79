A sonic balance is achieved by infusing elements of funk, hip-hop, dubstep, and drum 'n' bass. The music is structured while allowing space for spontaneous shifts in rhythm and melody. The result is an intriguing blend of improvisation and composition that provides a framework for electric live shows.\n\nBrian Cornell ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Keys\nMark Cooley ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Guitar / Programming\nMoe Velez ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Bass / Programming\nTynan Olsen - Drums\n\nThis is the MIX cd i got from them in Denver","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52844be78899774bcfbae5941cdc942b01344846","amp;dn":"Gravity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52844be78899774bcfbae5941cdc942b01344846","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,132,75,231,136,153,119,75,207,186,229,148,28,220,148,43,1,52,72,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
