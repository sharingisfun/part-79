One stubborn bird refuses to return to the roost, despite Betty's please. Pudgy, imagining himself a might hunting dog, attempts to catch the bird, with little success. When the pigeon gives Pudgy the slip, the little dog eventually wanders into the forest, where he falls asleep from exhaustion. The pigeon takes pity on Pudgy, and flies him back to Betty's home. When Pudgy wakes up on the roof, he tears up the picture of the hunting dog in frustration.\nProducer: Fleischer Studios\nAudio/Visual: sound, b/w","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:662bff0ee2441a729f040d652a5e8a179930482d","amp;dn":"Betty+Boop+-+Training+Pigeons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"662bff0ee2441a729f040d652a5e8a179930482d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,43,255,14,226,68,26,114,159,4,13,101,42,94,138,23,153,48,72,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
