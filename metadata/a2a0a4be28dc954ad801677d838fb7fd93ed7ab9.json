Guggenheim said he had his own instance of ADC, when a disembodied voice warned him to go check the swimming pool. He did, and found his young son on the verge of drowning and was able to save him. He believes the voice he heard was that of his own father, who passed away when he was 8 years old.\n\nGuggenheim, who coined the term ADC, defined it as a spiritual experience when &quot;someone is contacted directly and spontaneously&quot; by a deceased loved one or friend. The departed seek to let the living know that they're OK, and want to help alleviate the grieving process, he explained. He described cases where children reported seeing deceased relatives-- one teenager knew names of antiquated plumbing tools that he said were told to him by his deceased grandfather, a master plumber. Another boy could recite statistics of the St. Louis Browns, a baseball team his departed Uncle played on, but was long gone.\n\nHe shared the story of Katherine Cochran, a woman who received an after-death communication from her brother-in-law during a vivid dream (dreams are a common way the dead may contact the living), and subsequently began to hear lyrics and melodies that she used to compose songs,even though she had no previous musical background. While ADCs typically come unbidden, Guggenheim suggested that if people have a meditation practice, they will tend to be more open to intuitions.\n\nWebsite(s):\nafter-death.com\nspiritlyric.com\n\nBook(s):\nHello from Heaven!\n\n\n\n\nbrought to you by:\n                                                \n .d8888b.                                                      888    \nd88P  Y88b                                                     888    \n888    888                                                     888    \n888    888 888  888  .d88b.  888d888 .d8888b  8888b.  .d8888b  888888 \n888    888 888  888 d8P  Y8b 888P&quot;  d88P&quot;        &quot;88b 88K      888    \n888    888 Y88  88P 88888888 888    888      .d888888 &quot;Y8888b. 888    \nY88b  d88P  Y8bd8P  Y8b.     888    Y88b.    888  888      X88 Y88b.  \n &quot;Y8888P&quot;    Y88P    &quot;Y8888  888     &quot;Y8888P &quot;Y888888  88888P'  &quot;Y888 \n\nTorrents: http://thepiratebay.se/user/0vercast/\nRSS: http://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/2eb7e342dacfa8938e79732ad03e1224","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2a0a4be28dc954ad801677d838fb7fd93ed7ab9","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+AM+-+Sep+08+2009+-+After-Death+Communications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2a0a4be28dc954ad801677d838fb7fd93ed7ab9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,160,164,190,40,220,149,74,216,1,103,125,131,143,183,253,147,237,122,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
