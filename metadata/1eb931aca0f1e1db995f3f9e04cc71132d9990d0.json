Unfortunately it was perhaps a hundred times larger (and more impressive) then the HUDF and thus not widely circulated. But i spent today making a composite using the same technique as google earth, so you can view it in your browser quickly and using little bandwidth.\n\nEvery point of light in the image is an entire galaxy with billions of stars like our own.\n\nLet me know what you think. PS. If you can help me identify the images origins that would be wonderful.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1eb931aca0f1e1db995f3f9e04cc71132d9990d0","amp;dn":"Hubble+Galaxy+Image","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1eb931aca0f1e1db995f3f9e04cc71132d9990d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,185,49,172,160,241,225,219,153,95,63,158,4,204,113,19,45,153,144,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
