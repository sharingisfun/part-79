It is either unusually smooth industrial or unusually abrasive ambient music (with occasional side stops in 80s-inspired Synthpop), with songs acting as soundtracks to non-existent films about intergalactic tunnel worms, Moon Fish, &amp; cannibalistic swamp hermits. Listen to it &amp; you will never be unhappy again. This is a guarantee (this is not a guarantee).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ececfd3363ca9bdf9afff7d474612f4735e114e0","amp;dn":"Owen+Gilbride+-+Plate+Tectonics+%28flac%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ececfd3363ca9bdf9afff7d474612f4735e114e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,236,253,51,99,202,155,223,154,255,247,212,116,97,47,71,53,225,20,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
