The album may pop up on Itunes in the future, but will remain free indefinitely.\nAlso includes some tracks from other artists that I just happen to like, please don't sue me.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b29ecdaf22dd645fa9c88bfc8d43da349f1fb3c","amp;dn":"Bleach+Fiend+-+Loose+Excuse+For+Music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b29ecdaf22dd645fa9c88bfc8d43da349f1fb3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,41,236,218,242,45,214,69,250,156,136,191,200,212,61,163,73,241,251,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
