In the \n first season the makers depicted the daily occurrences of the imprisoned \n life of the two rabbits. The portrayal of the regular life of the rabbits \n is also done with much dexterity and the audiences seem to enjoy it all the \n more. The second series of the show portrays the adventurous circumstances \n under which they escape and shows their life on the run.\n\n The show has gained huge popularity all over Japan. The storyline also has \n interesting twists and turns and focuses on the life of two rabbits named \n Kirenenko and Putin respectively. They were imprisoned in a Russian gulag \n and had no hopes of being free from the shackles of the evils.\n\n They could not even spend carefree days in their little cell and were very \n much disappointed over their present state of affairs. Soon followed their \n constant battles with the guards in which they always produced some comedy \n or the other by bringing in all sorts of puns. In fact the whole show turned \n into a riotously funny slapstick comedy in the course of time. This unique \n production from the Kanaban Graphics indeed comes with a lot of twists and \n turns in the sequences of plots and its further development.\n\n Usavich is a really worth watching comedy. It is also described by some as \n bizarre series. The fusion of 3D animation and traditional 2D illustration \n is really a thing which deserves special praise about this series. It is \n always expected that you will imbibe hallucinogen of choice while watching \n this series. The funny little creatures involving themselves in a series of \n adventurous twists and turns really makes the audience and also children\n sit back and take notice of them. This show is enjoyed by young and old alike.\n\n The cartoon series also got a very high rating in the Atlantic Film Festival \n of the year 2007. This type of shows are very common in Japan but among all \n of them Usavich carved a special niche for itself in the hearts of its \n audiences. The funny Japanese series is also a great watch for the audience \n worldwide and especially the kids will have a blast of time and definitely\n demand a pair of rabbits on their next birthday.
