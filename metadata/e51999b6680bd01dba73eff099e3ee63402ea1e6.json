An annoying logo ad.\nNOT NOW!\nCopy these files into the Gears of WarWarGameMovies folder.\n(in case this doesnt show the backslashes, find the &quot;Gears of War&quot; then the &quot;WarGame&quot; folder, then the &quot;Movies&quot; folder.\nStart the game and wala! go right to the game!!! On this one, the screen will blank a few seconds and then bring up the game menu.\nAll I did was zero out the &quot;bik&quot; ad intro.\nYou still get the game intro, just not the minute long adds!\n\nThis file is zipped up, so download and just unzip it in that folder!\nBe watching for more for other games as over the next few days I will be releasing a \nbunch more of these.\n\n(Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯`Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¸Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¸.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯`Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·-=BeDLaM=- @ TiMeS2 FxPÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â·Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯`Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¸Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¸.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯)\n\n\nFeel free to comment so others know how this works","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e51999b6680bd01dba73eff099e3ee63402ea1e6","amp;dn":"Gears+Of+War+AD+and+credits+Intro+remover.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e51999b6680bd01dba73eff099e3ee63402ea1e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,25,153,182,104,11,208,29,186,115,239,240,153,227,238,99,64,46,161,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
