Thomas Uncles (Damon Wayans Jr.) and his crew are engaged in a fierce showdown which results in a tie. During the dance off, Thomas pees on the competition, only to be countered with a dancer who spins so fast he drills into the floor. The judge says that the only way to settle the score is with a rematch. Thomas doesnt want to bet someone elses money on the match, but one of his crew says they can win if they pull off a signature move. Thomas warns against it since the person who does the move could become crippled for life. Thomas tells him that theres no I in team and the other man starts listing words that could have an I and include others. He disregards what Thomas is saying and bets 5,000 on the outcome of the match. The judge lies about the amount of money several times, each time getting a gun pointed at his head until he announces that the winner walks away with 10,000 dollars.\n\n\n\n\nCOMEDY","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47c15e836f94412df9bbe54c83ec0adc4e36fc40","amp;dn":"Dance+Flick.2009.DvdRip.Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47c15e836f94412df9bbe54c83ec0adc4e36fc40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,193,94,131,111,148,65,45,249,187,229,76,131,236,10,220,78,54,252,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
