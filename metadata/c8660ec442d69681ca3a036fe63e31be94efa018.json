The song was recorded throughout the winter of 2009 with\n   Destroyer collaborators/members John Collins and David Carswell at JCDC\n   Studio in Vancouver. &quot;Bay of Pigs&quot; is an account of the 1961 American\n   invasion of Cuba. The music for &quot;Ravers&quot; was played entirely on analogue\n   synthesizer, and recorded in April 2009. It explores some of the more\n   meditative realms of 20th Century classical composition. The song is a casual\n   rumination on parties, political parties, madness and suffering (for one's\n   art).\n\n\n   Limited edition vinyl (1,000) now sold out... check your local independent\n   record store while copies are still available!\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  01.
