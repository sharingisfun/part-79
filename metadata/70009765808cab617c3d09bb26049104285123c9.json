I guess The Melvins\nare too busy now so he has a new band that features members of Faith No More,\nSharkbait, Hellworms and others. This album rules and it sounds just like\nDead Kennedys at their prime. Gotta love the title and theme of the album..\nObama was so full of shit and it's just sad that he fooled so many people.\nBuy this album to support a punk icon and his great label.\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n01.
