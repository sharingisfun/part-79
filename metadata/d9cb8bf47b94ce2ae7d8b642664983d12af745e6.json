This conclusion, however, was not arrived at through analysis of current events only. It is supported by a sound Biblical study of theological and eschatological factors in relationship to current political/religious trends. Even though the conclusions may differ from mainstream theology and political correctness, there can be no doubt that this assemblage of facts and data, both from the secular and inspired writers should raise concern and introspection in all who read this book. Before reading it is recommended that the reader sets aside any preconceived theological and environmental views that may hinder a deeper understanding of current events and future spiritual realities. 95 pages. A must read for everyone.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9cb8bf47b94ce2ae7d8b642664983d12af745e6","amp;dn":"Wedemeyer-Coming+Environmental+Sabbath%281996%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9cb8bf47b94ce2ae7d8b642664983d12af745e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,203,139,244,123,148,206,42,231,216,182,66,102,73,131,209,42,247,69,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
