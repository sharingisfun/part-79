It has \n\nbeen used in feature films, commercials, games, music videos and print ads since 1999. \n\n messiah can be used as a stand-alone animation package or as a powerful addition to \n\nMaya, 3D Studio MAX, LightWave, Cinema 4D or an in-house proprietary application \n\nthrough the Host Connection plugins and Host API .  One of messiah's many unique \n\ncapabilities includes the ability to set up an animation and, through messiah's host \n\nconnections, run that animation and use it in any of the host programs messiah can \n\nconnect to.  The same animation can be used and moved between each software. Maya \n\nusers love our powerful and easy rigging capabilities, such as the ability to setup \n\ncustom control rigs with Armature, without having to write MEL scripts.  Another \n\nfavorite is messiah's &quot;smart bones&quot;, that work the way you want immediately, without \n\nrequiring weight maps (though weighting systems can be used too).\n\nTorrent includes program, installation text file in english and screenshot images.\n\nAll needed cracks and serial numbers are include to run as full version.\n\nFor Vista and Windows 7 user, disabling UAC or 'Run as administrator' may be needed.\n\nTested on Windows 7 RC 7100 x32 and scanned with Microsoft Security Essentials.\n\nIf you like this program buy the latest version or upgrade, sometimes 30 days is not enough time to evaluate a program.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5386d751627e6c47c5f851b3b0b5fda1bbe14ef7","amp;dn":"pmG+Worldwide+messiahStudio+3.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5386d751627e6c47c5f851b3b0b5fda1bbe14ef7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,134,215,81,98,126,108,71,197,248,81,179,176,181,253,161,187,225,78,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
