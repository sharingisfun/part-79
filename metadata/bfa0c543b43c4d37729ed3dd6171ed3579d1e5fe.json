What Really Happened is proud to be one of the oldest political blogs on the net.\nRivero runs the WhatReallyHappened radio show on GCN six days a week, and makes good use of his sharp wit to help his blog visitors and radio listeners not only to read/hear the news but to understand what IS really happening. \n\n===============================================================\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfa0c543b43c4d37729ed3dd6171ed3579d1e5fe","amp;dn":"What+Really+Happened+-+July+03+SA+%5Bsebaygo1%5D+%286%2F12+rerun%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfa0c543b43c4d37729ed3dd6171ed3579d1e5fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,160,197,67,180,60,77,55,114,158,211,221,97,113,237,53,121,209,229,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
