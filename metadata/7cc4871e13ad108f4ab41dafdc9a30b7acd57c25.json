After endless parties, too many dead end jobs and family arguments, Bailey becomes Self-Destructive. Resorting to violence and severing all ties of friendship and love, Bailey enters a world where his friends are unable to follow. After a self-imposed exile Bailey returns to London to apologise, things have changed. Not everyone is sympathetic to his sudden re-appearance and there are others who will stop at nothing to make Bailey's life a living hell. Faced with a relationship lost amongst affluence and drug fueled parties, Bailey must accept his own limitations and confront the demons of his past.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cc4871e13ad108f4ab41dafdc9a30b7acd57c25","amp;dn":"Breathe.2009.DVDRip.XviD-AVCDVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cc4871e13ad108f4ab41dafdc9a30b7acd57c25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,196,135,30,19,173,16,143,74,180,29,175,220,154,48,183,172,213,124,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
