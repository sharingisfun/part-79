What makes storms, earthquakes and other events into natural disasters is not how they occur, but where they strike.\n\nMEGA DISASTERS asks the what ifs no one ever wants to face. A masterful blend of actual footage, computer graphics and interviews with leading scientists and public safety experts explores the outer limits of what could happen if everything went wrong.\n\nProduced naturally by many biological processes (digestion, decay, etc.) and collected naturally in natural gas fields and undersea basins, methane has proven to be a useful source of energy. Yet it is conceivable that this noxious, naturally-occurring gas has the capacity to destroy modern civilization.\n\nTheories suggest that gigantic eruptions of methane gas from deep in the ocean have occurred regularly throughout history.\n\nMEGA DISASTERS reconstructs just what such a horrifying event would be like. Even a small explosion in the mid-Pacific would create wave after wave of tsunamis, wiping out Hawaii and much of the West Coast. Hellish clouds of methane and water would burn across the skies, floods would annihilate inland regions, and most plant life would be destroyed.\n\nWe would be plunged into a modern Dark Age.\n\nExperience the horrors of a METHANE EXPLOSION through the riveting graphics and dramatic commentary of MEGA DISASTERS!\n\nDuration: 44:23\nA/R (W*H): 1:1.78 1280*720\nVcodec: x264\nAcodec: AC3 2.0\n\nPls. help seed to keep torrent alive!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ac30cf09e0835cb9016e9a866290900a1f8faf4","amp;dn":"THC-HD+Mega+disasters_+Methane+explosion+x264+AC3+720p.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ac30cf09e0835cb9016e9a866290900a1f8faf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,195,12,240,158,8,53,203,144,22,233,168,102,41,9,0,161,248,250,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
