(You can skip this step because i included deamon tools for you XD)\n4.  get daemon tools onto your computer\n5.  take dev-pk1.cue and mount it on daemon tools\n6.  it should start an instalation\n7.  follow the steps to the installation\n8.  the cd key is c3df-0387-a9dd-f95a\n9.  then when it asks for the next cd you mount dev-pk2.cue on deamon tools and click ok on installation\n\n10.  when it asks for the final disk then you mount the last .cue file-dev-pk3.cue\n11.  it will then complete the instalation\n12.  RESTART YOUR COMPUTER\n13.  now go back to deamon tools\n14.  mount dev-pk1.cue again and it should start the installation agan\n15.  STOP THE INSTALLATION\n16.  go to your start menue and click my computer\n17.  there should be something there called PK_1 (G:)\n18.  right click on it and select &quot;explore&quot;\n19.  there should be a folder in there called DEViANCE\n20.  copy it to your desktop\n21.  open the folder\n22.  go to 'my computer; local c disk; program files; (for my xp computer it was dreamcatcher); and find the painkiller folder\n23.  in the painkiller folder there should be folder called BIN\n24.  open it up and in there, there should be a file called Engine.dll\n25.  replace that .dll file with the one in the DEViANCE folder\n26.  finally what you need to do is restart your computer 1 more time\n27.  then when your computer is done reboting you download the patch and enjoy\n\nTHANK YOU FOR DOWNLOADING!!!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00cef912f511caf9e57f701e99de10ada9e67b82","amp;dn":"PainKiller","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00cef912f511caf9e57f701e99de10ada9e67b82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,206,249,18,245,17,202,249,229,127,112,30,153,222,16,173,169,230,123,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
