While working one weekend, Richard and Larry discover that someone has been stealing money from the company. They report it to Lomax. Unfortunately for Richard and Larry, it was Lomax and his henchmen who had been doing the stealing. Lomax lures them to his summer home with the promise of a relaxing weekend - little do they know he's hired a hit man to knock them off. Shortly after the guys arrive, Lomax dies, presumably from a drug overdose. This thwarts the hitman's plan since he was supposed to wait until Lomax had left his home. Eventually, Richard and Larry realize what is going on and they decide to prop Bernie up and cart him around with them so that they cannot be killed. Hilarity ensues. \n\n\nCan anyone post Weekend At Bernie's II (1993) in DVD-R\n(if possible with portuguese subtitles, or at least english subtitles)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7646f88ff1e0458a6d9a83dee8993d504b81e25b","amp;dn":"Weekend+at+Bernie%5C%27s+%281989%29+WS+NTSC+DVDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7646f88ff1e0458a6d9a83dee8993d504b81e25b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,70,248,143,241,224,69,138,109,154,131,222,232,153,61,80,75,129,226,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
