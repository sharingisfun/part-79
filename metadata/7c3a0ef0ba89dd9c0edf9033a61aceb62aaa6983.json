It remains her highest-charting hit in the United States, reaching #3 on the Billboard Hot 100. This song was one of the earliest to deal with child abuse and domestic violence. One critic said, &quot;the 'happy' music is a metaphorical denial, making this seem beautiful and serene while discussing something terrible and devastating. It is a wonderful use of tune as a metaphor for how many abuse victims also deny their abuse, and is a profound classic&quot;.\n\nSuzanne Nadine Vega (born July 11, 1959, Santa Monica, California) is an American songwriter and singer known for her highly literate lyrics and eclectic folk-inspired music.\n\nTwo of Vega's songs (both from her second album Solitude Standing, 1987) reached the top 10 of various international chart listings: &quot;Luka&quot; and &quot;Tom's Diner&quot;. The latter was originally an a cappella version on Vega's album, which was then remade in 1990 as a dance track produced by the British dance production team DNA.\n\nSolitude Standing is Suzanne Vega's platinum second album, released in 1987. It is the most popular and critically-acclaimed of her career. As can be seen by the CD insert, many of the songs had been written prior to 1987.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c3a0ef0ba89dd9c0edf9033a61aceb62aaa6983","amp;dn":"Suzanne+Vega+-+Luka+%28Live+at+Montreux%29++%28Xvid-2nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c3a0ef0ba89dd9c0edf9033a61aceb62aaa6983","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,58,14,240,186,137,221,156,14,223,144,51,166,26,206,182,42,170,105,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
