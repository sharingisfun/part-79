A certain level of AI has been reached but these machines are far from perfect, and seem to malfunction with some regularity. This background sets the scene for Tom Sellek and his partner who are police officers who specialize in deactivating &quot;runaway robots.&quot; It also forshadows the evil genius Gene Simmons who has a bunch of wonderful (and lethal) robotic &quot;toys.&quot; He also has developed an explosive &quot;smart bullet&quot; which is encoded with a specific target's thermal pattern and can home in on that target, even around corners. Anyway, without giving anything away, the plot gets more involved as Sellek and partner track down Simmons to a final exciting showdown.\n\nRun Time: 99 minutes\nLanguage: English\n\ncredit InFeCtiouS(JDPennington) BIG BIG BIG TIME &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7555991fa5b515c4406f36649c48b0d6cbb4efe1","amp;dn":"Runaway%28SciFi%29DVDRip+XviD-InFeCtiouS%28JDPennington%29%5BExtraTorrent%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7555991fa5b515c4406f36649c48b0d6cbb4efe1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,85,153,31,165,181,21,196,64,111,54,100,156,72,176,214,203,180,239,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
