Totally convincing, Clarke shows a true understanding of both his subject matter and of the medium in general. Using the documentary style to a devastated effect, the film has a feeling of utter truth. Gary Oldman in particular conveys an extraordinary performance of raw power as the chief hooligan. \n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:969d29ac5b15cd17e433e6dc4efdd3d36eb27208","amp;dn":"The+Firm++%281988%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"969d29ac5b15cd17e433e6dc4efdd3d36eb27208","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,157,41,172,91,21,205,23,228,51,230,220,78,253,211,211,110,178,114,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
