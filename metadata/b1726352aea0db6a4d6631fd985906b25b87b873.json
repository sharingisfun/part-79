Society has categorized Vincent Freeman as less than suitable given his genetic make-up and he has become one of the underclass of humans that are only useful for menial jobs. To move ahead, he assumes the identity of Jerome Morrow, a perfect genetic specimen who is a paraplegic as a result of a fall. With some professional advice, Vincent learns to deceive DNA and urine sample testing. When a colleague is killed he is finally scheduled for a space mission, but a colleague suspects his origins and the police begin an investigation.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFans of science fiction know, this is probably one of the best Sci-Fi films ever made.  Released in 1997, just over a decade ago, the advances in genetic science since then make this not just science fiction, but nearly a few steps away from reality.  Already it is becoming &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;standard procedure&quot; to test a fetus during pregnancy for genetic diseases and abnormalities, with the mapping of the human genome finished years before it was scheduled to be completed, who knows how soon the ability to physically manipulate a fetus or a fertilized egg before birth really is ...\n\n\nAs this is one of my favorite films, I know a couple bits of trivia about it:\n 1. The name &quot;Gattaca&quot; is not only the name of the space-exploration agency that Vincent works for, it is composed of the letters for the four nucleotide bases that form the proteins of DNA (adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine).  In addition to that though, the most common &quot;tandem repeats&quot; in genetic material are &quot;GATA or CA&quot;, which put together forms &quot;Gataca&quot;, they added a T just to make it look better.\n 2. Jerome asks Vincent to call him by his middle name, &quot;Eugene&quot;, which is in fact the root word of the science of genetic engineering - &quot;Eugenics&quot;.\n 3. The Gattaca building as seen in the film is actually the Marin County Civic Center which was the largest and last building designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, and was also seen in George Lucas's &quot;1984-ish&quot; THX 1138.\n 4. In the film, Vincent is shorter than Jerome which is something they have to correct physically by performing a leg-lengthening procedure (which is not far-fetched and is legal in some countries, including China, Russia, Canada, and France).  However, in reality, Jude Law and Ethan Hawke are exactly the same height.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdditional Info\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike all my iPod torrents, these files have their ID3 tags preformatted for your ease!
