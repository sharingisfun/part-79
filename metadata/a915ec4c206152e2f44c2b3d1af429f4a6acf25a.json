How do we manage to block out intense pain? How does our sense of balance keep working under the most extreme conditions? Live action combined with special effects creates incredible imagery to convey the 'feeling' of how our senses work. As an alarm bell goes off, we 'see' the noise, slowed down thousands of times. Ripples of sound roll towards us; we spin around and follow a sound wave as it travels into the dark outer ear canal.\n\nProgramme 1 - Smell and Taste\n\nNigel Marven goes in search of the most disgusting , the most attractive smells and sets out to discover the biological reasons why humans eat such a diverse range of foods, from rotten raw ducks eggs to a sweaty blue cheese. At a chilli eating contest, he pushes his taste buds to the limit.\n\nFormat : AVI\nLength : 465 MiB for 49mn 57s 864ms\nCodec : XviD\nSource : PDTV\n\nVideo #0 : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 160 Kbps\nAspect : 528 x 384 (1.375) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0 : MPEG Audio at 128 Kbps\nInfos : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a915ec4c206152e2f44c2b3d1af429f4a6acf25a","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Human+Senses+1+of+3+%282004%29+%5BPDTV%5D%7EEkolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a915ec4c206152e2f44c2b3d1af429f4a6acf25a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,21,236,76,32,97,82,226,244,76,43,61,26,244,41,244,166,172,242,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
