He has to be blind, def, can't read and can't operate a computer nimwit Traitor to The USA. That's all I got to say to that Benedict Arnold dropping.

THIS IS INSANITY.\n\nI am using a SEED BOX that uploads at rates of up to 2mb/s per leecher. The Seed Box can be identified by this IP address perf029c.xirvik.net. If you hook up with this server open up your client for maximum download speed. Be patient, it takes a awhile to hook up to it and build up speed. Not all leechers hook up and get high download speeds, so it is important to seed long.  \n\nThe More You share the More shares you will receive, may Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord.
