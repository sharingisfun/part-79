The strong-willed         \n    woman -- crusading feminist, bisexual, mother of an interracial baby     \n    with an African-American GI -- was a maverick figure, particularly in    \n    1970s Japan. Hara captures his subject in excruciating detail over a     \n    period of several years in this keenly personal work, which caused a     \n    scandal when it was released.                                            \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
