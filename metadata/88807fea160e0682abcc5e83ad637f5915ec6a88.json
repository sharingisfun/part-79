Onlookers say the image is a miracle because the distinct colors and outline of the image on the truck match the image of Virgin Guadalupe.\n\nThe Pachuca's say they will continue to welcome anyone who wants to see the image, because the image isn't going to go away anytime soon.\n\n&quot;I think we're going to just put it on a shelf outside, probably take off the mirror and keep it there cause its something special to us. I'm not going to wash it off,&quot; says Cristal Pachuca.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88807fea160e0682abcc5e83ad637f5915ec6a88","amp;dn":"ABC+News+Virgin+Mary+Seen+in+Bird+Poop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88807fea160e0682abcc5e83ad637f5915ec6a88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,128,127,234,22,14,6,130,171,204,94,131,173,99,127,89,21,236,106,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
