I think anyone interested in Hawes should try and pickup everything he's done. You won't be sorry, because the music swings and that's what matters. He is also quite good on ballads, which shows a completely different side of any musician. Hawes is joined by his then usual trio of Red Mitchell and Chuck Thompson. Another stellar release from Hampton. ~ J. Rich\n\nOh, yeah, baby. This is some serious 50s groovin'. A really beautiful trio featuring nimble piano, brushy drums, and bass solidly in place.  to it over and over until your head explodes. ~ A Customer, Amazon.com\n\nHampton Hawes Trio - Vol 3 - Everybody Likes Hampton Hawes Tracks:\n01  Somebody Loves Me   \n02  Sermon   \n03  Embraceable You   \n04  I Remember You   \n05  Night in Tunisia   \n06  Lover, Come Back to Me   \n07  Polka Dots and Moonbeams   \n08  Billy Boy   \n09  Body and Soul   \n10  Coolin' the Blues","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0070ffd36fcae6652cdf310be7fbb129859a285a","amp;dn":"Hampton+Hawes+Trio+-+Vol+3+%281956%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bschon55%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0070ffd36fcae6652cdf310be7fbb129859a285a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,112,255,211,111,202,230,101,44,223,49,11,231,251,177,41,133,154,40,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
