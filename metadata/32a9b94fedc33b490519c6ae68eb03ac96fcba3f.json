Really not for everyone, K.D. is one of the most interesting and demanding prog acts of the last decade. During K.D.'s development their style changed more and more from heavy metal influenced apocalyptic trips to notable calmer post-rock experiments.\n\nFurther information to K.D's albums you can find at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=1870&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=1870&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAlbums:\n\n2003 - Choirs of the Eye\n2006 - Dowsing Anemone With Copper Tongue\n2008 - Blue Lambency Downward\n2010 - Coyote","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32a9b94fedc33b490519c6ae68eb03ac96fcba3f","amp;dn":"Kayo+Dot+-+The+Studio+Albums+%282003-2010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32a9b94fedc33b490519c6ae68eb03ac96fcba3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,169,185,79,237,195,59,73,5,25,198,174,104,235,3,172,150,252,186,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
