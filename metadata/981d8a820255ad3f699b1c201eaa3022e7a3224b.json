Move the duplicate layer to the bottom edge of the original iPhone, then bring down the opacity to about 50%. Finally, add an opacity mask using a linear gradient to make the reflection fade away. Finally, you can add the iPhone and Apple logo, then distort your billboard's perspective.\n\n*** Build elements of the iPhone\nAs always, Bert re-creates everything from scratch. He uses many different paths to draw the iPhone and gives a tour of all the shapes built, including the iPhone hardware, the screen, the icons, and even the detailed logos within the icons. Most shapes include some effects such as Inner Shadow, Bevel and Emboss, and Satin. However, underlying all of these effects are just simple shapes. Each element of the iPhone, including the screen detail and highlights, are on separate, labeled layers. Make sure to name your layers because there will be many.\n\n*** Use Illustrator to draw icons\nMany of the icons appear to have gears and starbursts. Draw these in illustrator and import them into Photoshop as Paths. All of the detail are added in Photoshop, including shading, gradients, and colors.\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nAll episodes can be streamed at Revision3 (duh!) but they can also be downloaded directly from the Revision3 site (they redirect to fast bitgravity servers) at various resolutions and video formats.
