The atheist pointed out that God afforded Paul and Thomas &quot;special&quot; one-time proofs. Why doesn't he give those proofs to all people? The atheist claims that Paul and Thomas would not believe based on what others said, so God provided a one-time proof for each of them. Why did God afford that privilege to those two, but not everyone? Listen to this episode as Joe breaks apart the argument piece by piece, and addresses this difficult question.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d354efd2d0b46306cc0887f8ba87655db9c27895","amp;dn":"Difficult+Questions+for+Christians.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d354efd2d0b46306cc0887f8ba87655db9c27895","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,84,239,210,208,180,99,6,204,8,135,248,186,135,101,93,185,194,120,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
