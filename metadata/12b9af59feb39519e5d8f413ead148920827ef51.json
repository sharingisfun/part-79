Its pretty lightweight stuff but good fun at the same time. Hope you enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12b9af59feb39519e5d8f413ead148920827ef51","amp;dn":"Red+Zone+-+Living+On+Lust+LP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12b9af59feb39519e5d8f413ead148920827ef51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,185,175,89,254,179,149,25,229,216,244,19,234,209,72,146,8,39,239,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
