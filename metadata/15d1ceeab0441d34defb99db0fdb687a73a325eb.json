It is very short, but during the three previous days, we will have travelled a long way and encountered many difficulties. It is a time to tend the wounds. Whilst the fighters will try and strike out in breakaways, the sprintersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ teams will want to ensure that the pack reaches the finish in a group. Wind may have been a factor if this race had taken place earlier in the season, because the roads are more open to the elements in northern France. However, at this time of year, with a fairly bumpy finish, it will not have much of an influence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15d1ceeab0441d34defb99db0fdb687a73a325eb","amp;dn":"2010+Tour+De+France+%28in+HD%29+-+Stage+4+-+2010-07-07+%28Cycling%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15d1ceeab0441d34defb99db0fdb687a73a325eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,209,206,234,176,68,29,52,222,251,153,219,15,219,104,122,115,163,37,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
