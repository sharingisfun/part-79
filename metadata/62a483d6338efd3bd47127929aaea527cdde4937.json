Enjoy.\n\nDescription: As an awkward youth you always felt that there was something greater meant for you. Meant only for you. In your village they never understood, but you always felt the divine hands of the gods resting upon your shoulders, guiding you onwards. Now, finally the time has come to understand what it is that they truly want from you. All the time they watch us mortals, playing games with our fate, yet now it is their fate which rests in the hands of but a few mortal beings.\n\nThe gods resting high upon Mount Olympus are beset on all sides by the jealousy of their contemporaries. The conflict has raged for eternity, the egos of each immortal grating against the others, until now there has to be resolution. The gods have each taken it upon themselves to shelter a mortal under their protective wing and guide them to glory. With the strongest of these heroes will come the strongest immortal who will then be crowned the most powerful above all.\n\nYou must align yourself to a patron-deity, but choose wisely for each is different and each offers challenges and rewards you will not find anywhere else. These divine tutors can bestow upon you gifts of new talents and abilities, but only if you learn to pay homage and offer them your devotion and respect.\n\nThe beautiful world in which your character inhabits is a fantastical world based upon the tenets of the great Greek myths. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an ancient Greece full of mythical creatures, legendary warriors and blood-thirsty, ambitious Gods. Villages and settlements spread out over vast seashores and stony plains, populated by both the peaceful and the hostile. Either of whom might just need a heroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s powersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦[/b]\n\n[img]http://nsa15.casimages.com/img/2010/05/14/100514012248394638.jpg[/img]\n\nFeatures:\n\n    * A deep, visually-engaging world populated my fabulous beasts, terrible monsters and brave heroes.\n    * An absorbing storyline, following your hero from their youthful beginnings to becoming a legendary hero, fighting for their patron-deity.\n    * Join up with other heroes to complete vital quests.\n    * Variety of weapons and combo moves to use and master.\n    * Compete against other heroes to become the one true champion.\n[img]http://nsa15.casimages.com/img/2010/05/14/100514012428373880.jpg[/img]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62a483d6338efd3bd47127929aaea527cdde4937","amp;dn":"Numen+Contest+of+Heroes-SKIDROW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62a483d6338efd3bd47127929aaea527cdde4937","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,164,131,214,51,142,253,59,212,113,39,146,154,174,165,39,205,222,73,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
